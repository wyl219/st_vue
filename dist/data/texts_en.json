Pay me no mind!","story_argon_07_04":"Yes, of course! How silly of me!","story_argon_07_05":"You there! Hiding behind the counter!","story_argon_07_06":"Ah! Uh, sorry, your Majesty. I'll get out of the way...","story_argon_07_07":"Nonsense! A Paladin-to-be is more than worthy of sitting next to my radiant self!","story_argon_07_08":"Sitting next to...

Wow!","story_argon_07_13":"I know all about them! Each is unique and decided by the Paladin itself...","story_argon_07_14":"It must be a dangerous task, like slaying a dragon... or destroying a dangerous artifact...","story_argon_07_15":"Indeed! Any sufficiently brave and selfless deed done for the sake of the kingdom will do!","story_argon_07_16":"I understand! Thank you, your Majesty! You won't regret it!","story_argon_07_17":"Of course not, I'm always right!","story_argon_07_18":"...Now then, since I am already undercover...","story_argon_07_19":"You there! Old man!

I have no clue!","story_argon_08_08":"It has to be something of epic and glorious proportions...","story_argon_08_09":"But Argon, you are glorious! You've defeated monsters far and wide...","story_argon_08_10":"Sure, but it has to be something more...","story_argon_08_11":"I've heard there are feathered demons at Bleakspire Peak, maybe that would do it....","story_argon_08_12":"Well whatever it is, I'm sure you're up for it!","story_argon_08_13":"Thanks, Lilu... Even when I was no longer a Knight, you kept believing in me...","story_argon_08_14":"Oh! Th-that was nothing!","story_argon_08_15":"Anyway! You'll need help in your quest!

I did not need this headache today.","story_argon_10b_02":"Lady Sia! How did it go?","story_argon_10b_03":"...Against all odds, King Reinhold is willing to forgive his own would-be assassin.","story_argon_10b_04":"While I am not so trustful, she did share valuable intel on her Azuman order.","story_argon_10b_05":"T-then this means...!","story_argon_10b_06":"Yes, we'll accept her surrender and apology.","story_argon_10b_07":"She is currently under medical care due to starvation, but she should make a full recovery.","story_argon_10b_08":"As for you, Paladin Argon...","story_argon_10b_09":"P-paladin!","story_argon_10b_10":"Yes, It is something to vanquish a threat, but to redempt a sworn enemy of the kingdom...","story_argon_10b_11":"It appears King Reinhold was right about you, after all.","story_argon_10b_12":"Now go and celebrate, Paladin. I'm sure you'll be very busy, very soon!","story_argon_10b_13":"I will! Thank you!","story_argon_10b_14":"Dad... I hope you're proud.","story_argon_epilogue_name":"Epilogue","story_argon_epilogue_01":"P-paladin!? You did it, Argon!","story_argon_epilogue_02":"I really thought I blew it for a moment there...","story_argon_epilogue_03":"But dad was right. All I need to do is follow my heart!","story_argon_epilogue_04":"Ah... but does that mean you'll be sent away on campaign overseas?","story_argon_epilogue_05":"Not yet. Lady Sia hopes I can teach Heroes to become Paladins.","story_argon_epilogue_06":"Ah! That's a relief! ...Though I have a hard time imagining you as a teacher.","story_argon_epilogue_07":"Won't you be busy with super important Paladin quests?","story_argon_epilogue_08":"I'll do my best! The kingdom is counting on me!","story_argon_epilogue_09":"Hi there, noble Paladin!","story_argon_epilogue_10":"Brohm told me he was looking for some more smelting gloves!","story_argon_epilogue_11":"Yes! Right away!","story_argon_epilogue_12":"...Some things never change, huh?","story_argon_epilogue_13":"Not our Argon, that's for sure.","story_argon_a_name":"The Tower of Titans","story_argon_a_01":"The Tower of Titans, eh?","story_argon_a_02":"Please tell us all about it!","story_argon_a_03":"I heard some Heroes whisper about it, but no one has ever seen it...","story_argon_a_04":"Indeed, the Tower of Titans is a mythical place. Nobody really knows if it truly exists.","story_argon_a_05":"Stories say it appears out of thin air, challenging the mightiest Heroes to climb its many floors...","story_argon_a_06":"...Before suddenly disappearing, wiping clean the memories of anyone who may have seen it.","story_argon_a_07":"W-wiping memories!?","story_argon_a_08":"That's strange... where would the legend come from, then?","story_argon_a_09":"Right! Some people would need to remember!","story_argon_a_10":"It is said that those who overcome the Titan's challenge are deemed worthy by the Tower.","story_argon_a_11":"These Heroes return... changed from the experience, and retain their memories.","story_argon_a_12":"More accurately, a part of them remains in the Tower, and a part of the Tower remains with them.","story_argon_a_13":"...That will be all for today's story time. Thank you for listening to this old man's tales.","story_argon_a_14":"Wow! I wonder if it truly exists?","story_argon_a_15":"Yeah! I'd love to explore a dungeon like that!","story_argon_a_16":"But one thing seems strange...

I could've sworn it was sparkling clean yesterday...","story_argon_b_07":"Argon... Do you think...?","story_argon_b_08":"Ahoy! Are any of ye fine landlubbers on the market for some <c1>Juggernaut Greaves</c1>?","story_argon_b_09":"No... especially not twenty of them! Where did you get all that!?","story_argon_b_10":"Hah!

Thanks to your help, I got plenty of free time now!","story_lilu_00_hire_02":"As promised, now it's my turn to help you out!","story_lilu_00_hire_03":"I'm still a novice at magic, but there's a few healing spells I'd like to try out...","story_lilu_00_hire_04":"Send me out anytime!","story_lilu_01_name":"Precocious Apprentice","story_lilu_01_01":"Well, Pollux? What do you think of this new spell? Perfect, right?","story_lilu_01_02":"Yeah, this time we'll ace it for sure!","story_lilu_01_03":"Good morning, Lilu. Here for the weekly shipment of Living Roots?","story_lilu_01_04":"Yes, thank you, Maribel!","story_lilu_01_05":"You sure ordered a lot this week! What's your master doing with all of these?","story_lilu_01_06":"To be honest, about half of it is for me. I'm doing some serious studying!","story_lilu_01_07":"Oh? What kind?","story_lilu_01_08":"Healing spells! I've spent all of last week mending cuts and bruises at the Training Hall!","story_lilu_01_09":"Right, I'm sure the Heroes are glad to have you around.","story_lilu_01_10":"...And Argon, too!","story_lilu_01_11":"...!","story_lilu_01_12":"I- I gotta go! Thanks!","story_lilu_02_name":"Grim Tidings","story_lilu_02_01":"Here you go, Master Grimar. This week's Living Roots.","story_lilu_02_02":"Thank you, Lola. Here is today's homework.","story_lilu_02_03":"Oh! A magic tome! Is it about healing!?","story_lilu_02_04":"\"The Miscreant's Manual to Maledictions\"...?","story_lilu_02_05":"This book is way too advanced! It's even got an entire section about curses!","story_lilu_02_06":"...Curses?","story_lilu_02_07":"Hmm... curses...?","story_lilu_02_08":"Master?","story_lilu_02_09":"35 years ago, on this very day... I...!","story_lilu_02_10":"Master Grimar!?","story_lilu_02_11":"...I forgot. And who might you be?","story_lilu_02_12":"...I'm Lilu, your apprentice. Or Lola, sometimes...","story_lilu_02_13":"Oh well, nevermind. I'll be studying this book. Thanks, Grim.","story_lilu_03_name":"Addled Mind","story_lilu_03_01":"... Add in a pinch of Silver Dust and... done!","story_lilu_03_02":"Look at it glow! Not bad, huh Pollux?","story_lilu_03_03":"If the Miscreant's Manual to Malediction is correct, this potion should-","story_lilu_03_04":"Lola, what is all this ruckus? I'm trying to sleep here!","story_lilu_03_05":"Master Grimar! Thanks to your book, I brewed a very advanced potion! It should-","story_lilu_03_06":"You did what!?","story_lilu_03_07":"Well then, give it here! Let's have a taste!","story_lilu_03_08":"...","story_lilu_03_09":"Master Grimar?","story_lilu_03_10":"Lilu! I-mu-mu-must be fr-freed! Le-let me out of this doltish, half-witted mm-mind!","story_lilu_03_11":"M-master Grimar! Are you well?","story_lilu_03_12":"...","story_lilu_03_13":"*Burp* A little fruity!","story_lilu_03_14":"Not bad, Lola. Now then, back to your chores.","story_lilu_03_15":"...That was NOT normal.","story_lilu_04_name":"Bloodline's End","story_lilu_04_01":"Something isn't right with Master Grimar...","story_lilu_04_02":"His voice, it was as though someone was speaking from within him!","story_lilu_04_03":"Maybe we're dealing with a complex transmutation spell?","story_lilu_04_04":"Or maybe even-","story_lilu_04_05":"Dude, Lilu! Something went wrong at the king's feast!","story_lilu_04_06":"Tamas? What's going on?","story_lilu_04_07":"Something about an invader in the castle, dude. Pretty spooky!","story_lilu_04_08":"An invader...! Oh no, this is Argon's first day as a knight!","story_lilu_04_09":"Thanks Tamas, I gotta go!","story_lilu_04_10":"Oh no...! What's going on here!?","story_lilu_04_11":"Argon, where are you!?","story_lilu_04_12":"Aaargh...","story_lilu_04_13":"KING REINHOLD!? Are you alright!?","story_lilu_04_14":"Aahh... My precious life... fleeting...","story_lilu_04_15":"This is bad...!","story_lilu_04_16":"Focus Lilu! Remember the Sage training!","story_lilu_04_17":"King Reinhold! Hold still! <c1>Heal</c1>!","story_lilu_04_18":"It's no use... Please... preserve my beautiful corpse...","story_lilu_04_19":"No effect...","story_lilu_04_20":"Oh no.. could it be... Poison?","story_lilu_04_21":"...Just like my parents...! I won't fail this time! I can't!","story_lilu_04_22":"<c1>Greater Poison Purge!</c1>","story_lilu_04_23":"...Aaaah... Huh?","story_lilu_04_24":"King Reinhold! How do you feel?","story_lilu_04_25":"Wait a minute... That cup shielded you from that shuriken! You weren't harmed at all!","story_lilu_04_26":"Oh! Is that so? I suppose I may have overreacted a little bit.","story_lilu_04_27":"A monarch's death is a dramatic affair, after all.","story_lilu_04_28":"Argh! Reinhold!","story_lilu_05_name":"Pick your Poison","story_lilu_05_01":"Ugh... That was close... sort of.","story_lilu_05_02":"If Reinhold truly was poisoned... I don't think I could've saved him.","story_lilu_05_03":"I'll need to refocus my efforts. To ensure no one suffers loss like I did...","story_lilu_05_04":"Miss Sia!","story_lilu_05_05":"Ah, the star of the hour! A knight has been dispatched to deal with the intruder. You may rest easy.","story_lilu_05_06":"(A knight? Good luck, Argon!)","story_lilu_05_07":"Thank you for... saving our King, despite the circumstances.","story_lilu_05_08":"It was nothing! But if it were to happen again, I'm not sure I could help...","story_lilu_05_09":"Miss Sia, do you know about poisons?","story_lilu_05_10":"Of course. The aconitum, also known as Wolf's Bane, is a terribly efficient killer.","story_lilu_05_11":"But a personal favorite of mine is Ricin. Silent, deadly, and readily available...","story_lilu_05_12":"Um... What about curing them?","story_lilu_05_13":"Oh. I can't say I've ever given it much thought.","story_lilu_05_14":"...Forget I asked.","story_lilu_06_name":"Master and Student","story_lilu_06_01":"I'm back, Master Grimar!","story_lilu_06_02":"Ah, welcome back, Lola.","story_lilu_06_03":"Can you believe it? The King was nearly assassinated!","story_lilu_06_04":"Is that so...","story_lilu_06_05":"An assassin came out of nowhere and attacked him with a shuriken!","story_lilu_06_06":"And then, I rushed to his help as he was dying on the floor...!","story_lilu_06_07":"Erm... Who are you again?","story_lilu_06_08":"Oh right. Your condition... I need to get back to it!","story_lilu_06_09":"It might be a poison, too...","story_lilu_06_10":"Let's see... Grimar is super old...","story_lilu_06_11":"What do you think, Pollux?","story_lilu_06_12":"Yeah, we should ask around the city!","story_lilu_06_13":"Maybe some of the older residents remember what a younger Grimar acted like...","story_lilu_07_name":"Ancestral Knowledge","story_lilu_07_01":"Master Theodore!","story_lilu_07_02":"If it isn't Lilu! How can I help you today?","story_lilu_07_03":"I was wondering if you could tell me about Grimar, back when he was young...","story_lilu_07_04":"...Since you're uh... old and stuff.","story_lilu_07_05":"Ho ho ho! Of course, of course.","story_lilu_07_06":"Old Grimar has always been a bit of an... eccentric.","story_lilu_07_07":"But back when I was a wee lad, I remember him being much sharper. My equal at chess, even.","story_lilu_07_08":"After that trip to the Chronos Ruins though... He always felt a bit off, now that I think about it.","story_lilu_07_09":"The Chronos Ruins! That's such a dangerous place!","story_lilu_07_10":"...An entire civilization reduced to ruins while researching time magic... ","story_lilu_07_11":"That place is full of magical anomalies! What would Grimar have to gain by visiting such a place?","story_lilu_07_12":"You're right Pollux, it's our only clue. We'll have to go investigate!","story_lilu_07_13":"We would need an escort though... Should we ask Argon...?","story_lilu_07_14":"No! What if a time vortex suddenly turned him into an old man? Or like Grimar...","story_lilu_07_15":"...I can think of only one other person that could help us...","story_lilu_07_16":"It won't be easy Pollux! But we have to try!","story_lilu_07_17":"Thanks Theodore! You were a big help!","story_lilu_07_18":"No problem, Lilu! See you around!","story_lilu_07_19":"...","story_lilu_07_20":"...Just how smart is that owl...?","story_lilu_08_name":"Common Cause","story_lilu_08_01":"Mister Rudo, please! Don't walk away, I need to talk to you!","story_lilu_08_02":"Beat it kid, I don't wanna hear it.","story_lilu_08_03":"You and your owl can go play elsewhere!","story_lilu_08_04":"I know you don't like spellcasters... but I really need your help!","story_lilu_08_05":"I need to go deep into the Chronos Ruins, and I can't go alone! ","story_lilu_08_06":"Why don't you ask that kid Argon, your knight in shiny armor?","story_lilu_08_07":"He's... uh, busy with something else at the moment...","story_lilu_08_08":"I guess there is no point in asking you then...","story_lilu_08_09":"You got that right, kid.","story_lilu_08_10":"That is truly a shame, hun.","story_lilu_08_11":"I heard the Chronos Ruins Cyclops Lord has never been defeated in single combat...","story_lilu_08_12":"It would take an exceptional warrior to escort Lilu through these ruins!","story_lilu_08_13":"...Never defeated you say?","story_lilu_08_14":"Fine. I'll bite. How much smashing do I get to do?","story_lilu_08_15":"A lot, I'm sure!","story_lilu_08_16":"You see, I need to find the source of the time flux coming from the various crystals and isolate-","story_lilu_08_17":"Cut it short.","story_lilu_08_18":"...There are monsters and magical crystals to smash.","story_lilu_08_19":"Alright, sold. You owe me one, kid.","story_lilu_08_20":"Great! Thank you so much, mister Rudo!","story_lilu_08_21":"Save it for after our trip, kid. It's no walk in the park.","story_lilu_08_22":"I'll be there to heal your wounds if you face too many monsters!","story_lilu_08_23":"Hmph. Not likely.","story_lilu_08_24":"And thank you too, Naya!","story_lilu_08_25":"Not a problem, hun.","story_lilu_09_name":"Mirror World","story_lilu_09_01":"I'll keep the Cyclops busy! Move on ahead!","story_lilu_09_02":"C'mere, fat clops! I got some oats for ya!","story_lilu_09_03":"Got it! Good luck!","story_lilu_09_04":"This is it... the Chamber of Time. And according to my research...","story_lilu_09_05":"This basin should be connected to a fragmented timeline!","story_lilu_09_06":"A parallel universe where Chronos City is still thriving...","story_lilu_09_07":"Look, Pollux! If you gaze into the water... you can see something!","story_lilu_09_08":"Looks like the people of Chronos are living like normal, somewhere out there...","story_lilu_09_09":"Hey... doesn't this guy look like he's waving at us?","story_lilu_09_10":"He looks a lot like... Grimar!?","story_lilu_10a_name":"Curse of Ever Years","story_lilu_10a_01":"Grimar!!! Drink this!","story_lilu_10a_02":"Huh? There's something... familiar about this.","story_lilu_10a_03":"It's a special draught made with Chronos Water...","story_lilu_10a_04":"...Stabilized and twice-treated with Threads of Fate...?","story_lilu_10a_05":"...and bound into material form with distilled Ectoplasm.","story_lilu_10a_06":"With a pinch of Deep Coral, for taste!","story_lilu_10a_07":"Spectacular work, Lilu. A master could not be prouder.","story_lilu_10a_08":"G-grimar... You're back to normal! It worked!","story_lilu_10a_09":"What a peculiar experience... It's like a fog just left my mind...","story_lilu_10a_10":"I have a rough idea of how the potion works but... there's something that doesn't make sense.","story_lilu_10a_11":"We saw you in the basin! In the fragmented timeline!","story_lilu_10a_12":"Ho ho! Is that so? I have a theory on the matter...","story_lilu_10a_13":"Pollux, dear. Would you mind fetching old Owen? I believe there is much to explain...","story_lilu_10b_name":"Timesplit Theorem","story_lilu_10b_01":"Dear me, old friend! That is quite the tale!","story_lilu_10b_02":"I'm finding it hard to believe, myself... Grimar is a survivor from Chronos City?","story_lilu_10b_03":"When the Time Spell went astray, that entire city was tossed into another timeline.","story_lilu_10b_04":"I remember that day like it was yesterday. An entire city, gone in a flash!","story_lilu_10b_05":"All we found among the ruins was a lone, wandering child...","story_lilu_10b_06":"Grimar, right? It's hard to imagine you both as kids...","story_lilu_10b_07":"Ho ho! We became fast friends, didn't we?","story_lilu_10b_08":"That we did. I studied to become a wizard and look into this strange event myself.","story_lilu_10b_09":"If what Lilu saw is correct, then I believe another Grimar exists.","story_lilu_10b_10":"The other Grimar we saw... you still exist in the other timeline!?","story_lilu_10b_11":"So it seems. At first, there were no consequences but...","story_lilu_10b_12":"As both Grimars grew up, our life experiences and personalities began drifting apart.","story_lilu_10b_13":"And the growing magical paradox started taxing your mind...","story_lilu_10b_14":"I understand! Drinking a potion from the Chronos Ruins must connect you back to that other timeline!","story_lilu_10b_15":"That's my theory. I'm sure the other Grimar appreciates it, too.","story_lilu_10b_16":"Jeez... that's a lot to take in. I think I'll need to sleep on it... You coming, Pollux?","story_lilu_10b_17":"As for us, old Grim, I believe we have a lot of catching up to do!","story_lilu_10b_18":"Speak for yourself, old coot! I've never felt younger!","story_lilu_epilogue_name":"Epilogue","story_lilu_epilogue_01":"Hi Grimar! Here's a new recipe. It should last a bit longer!","story_lilu_epilogue_02":"A remarkable improvement! Your parents would be proud.","story_lilu_epilogue_03":"...If only I had studied alchemy a bit earlier...","story_lilu_epilogue_04":"I feel the same. If I were in full control of my functions, perhaps...","story_lilu_epilogue_05":"...It's fine. I decided to focus on the future. To become better, and save others from this fate.","story_lilu_epilogue_06":"...I'm sure that's what my parents would've wanted.","story_lilu_epilogue_07":"You've grown so much... I can hardly recognize you.","story_lilu_epilogue_08":"Actually... who are you again?","story_lilu_epilogue_09":"Oh no! The effect is already wearing off! I'd better-","story_lilu_epilogue_10":"Ho ho ho! Just kidding. I have a good feeling about this one.","story_lilu_epilogue_11":"Now then, while my head is clear. How about learning some magic?","story_lilu_epilogue_12":"The master still has a few tricks!","story_lilu_epilogue_13":"Oh! How about Polymorph? I'm looking forward to this!","story_lilu_a_name":"Hoarder of Ages","story_lilu_a_01":"Grimar, you didn't tell me you had a second <c1>Collection Book</c1>!","story_lilu_a_02":"<c1>Collection Book</c1>...? That does ring a bell...","story_lilu_a_03":"Wow! This one's packed with info! <c1>Damocles</c1>... <c1>Amber Citadel</c1>...","story_lilu_a_04":"<c1>Grimar's Grand Wand</c1>...? Did you name that one?","story_lilu_a_05":"There's so many pages! You must've been quite the collector!","story_lilu_a_06":"He most certainly was!","story_lilu_a_07":"Sondra... is that you, old friend?","story_lilu_a_08":"Wow! Do you guys know each other?","story_lilu_a_09":"Indeed. Young Grimar was absolutely enamored with his Collection Book.","story_lilu_a_10":"I believe it earned him a prestigious title among his human peers... \"Nerd\", was it?","story_lilu_a_11":"Ouch...","story_lilu_a_12":"We met during his quest for rare items, and created the <c1>Fusion Cauldron</c1> together.","story_lilu_a_13":"He would spend day and night fusing away hundreds of items... and even more during a full moon!","story_lilu_a_14":"All these efforts... but his collection is still incomplete!","story_lilu_a_15":"I swear I'll cure your condition, Master Grimar! You must finish your life's work!","story_lilu_a_16":"Time certainly is cruel to mankind. I wish you luck on your quest, little one.","story_sia_00_01":"Well, well, well... What do we have here?","story_sia_00_02":"Our city's newest merchant, was it? My name is Sia. It is an absolute pleasure to meet you.","story_sia_00_03":"As advisor to our esteemed King, I would like to personally welcome you to his kingdom.","story_sia_00_04":"And while I'm here, there's a little something I've been looking for...","story_sia_00_hire_01":"Shopkeeper... You've been so useful to me lately.","story_sia_00_hire_02":"As a token of our friendship, I offer you my services as a Champion.","story_sia_00_hire_03":"I have an eye for valuables that I'm sure you'll find more than useful...","story_sia_01_name":"Kingly First Steps","story_sia_01_01":"Sia! I've decided!","story_sia_01_02":"Yes, my King?","story_sia_01_03":"Today, I would like to go shopping!","story_sia_01_04":"An excellent idea, your Majesty.","story_sia_01_05":"However, looking at your schedule, it seems you are to meet foreign dignitaries today...","story_sia_01_06":"Oh, what a bore! Can't we just send them away?","story_sia_01_07":"Remember, my King, though you may be young, you are still King. Your word is law.","story_sia_01_08":"...You're absolutely right! Shopping it is, then! Those dignitaries can wait!","story_sia_01_09":"Your decisiveness is admirable. Shall I accompany you?","story_sia_01_10":"Of course! I trust no one else with the protection of my graceful self.","story_sia_02_name":"Friends in Low Places","story_sia_02_01":"...And so, I have reasons to believe our King's life may be in danger.","story_sia_02_02":"I see. Indeed, a few rival kingdoms would benefit from an attempt on the King's life.","story_sia_02_03":"I haven't seen any suspicious characters, but I'm sure Naya over at the tavern would know more.","story_sia_02_04":"Thank you, Elder. Your wisdom and patriotism is appreciated.","story_sia_02_05":"Don't mention it. It is my duty as a resident to ensure our kingdom's prosperity.","story_sia_02_06":"Though he may be young and foolish, I'm sure Reinhold will grow into a fine king... given time.","story_sia_02_07":"And it is my duty to see him live until then!","story_sia_02_08":"Well well, it's not often we see pretty blue blood down here at the tavern!","story_sia_02_09":"Cut the act, Naya, you know who I am.","story_sia_02_10":"Indeed! Sia Leonel, a gift to our King by the Kern emperor...","story_sia_02_11":"To act as an advisor, but also to keep tabs on him, am I right?","story_sia_02_12":"...!","story_sia_02_13":"...Nosy girl, aren't you?","story_sia_02_14":"Well then, tell me, nosy Naya...","story_sia_02_15":"Have you seen any strange faces in your tavern lately?","story_sia_02_16":"Oh, we get plenty of strange faces! Tipsy orcs, shopkeepers...","story_sia_02_17":"But the strangest of all would be that girl in the corner, over there.","story_sia_02_18":"...!","story_sia_02_19":"She escaped...","story_sia_02_20":"That was an Azuman spy! ...or assassin.","story_sia_02_21":"I'll need to be extra vigilant...","story_sia_03_name":"Gatecrasher","story_sia_03_01":"We have gathered you here today to celebrate the King's incredible generosity.","story_sia_03_02":"In the past months, he has donated several million gold from his own coffers...","story_sia_03_03":"...To several local temples, schools and orphanages.","story_sia_03_04":"All are welcome to this feast, so please tell your friends and family.","story_sia_03_05":"Long live King Reinhold!","story_sia_03_06":"Tyrant Reinhold, your reign ends now!","story_sia_03_07":"Aaargh...","story_sia_03_08":"A shuriken...! The Azuman spy!","story_sia_03_09":"Guards! Form a perimeter around the castle! Let none escape!","story_sia_03_10":"Argon, go after that assassin!","story_sia_03_11":"At once!","story_sia_03_12":"You! Unwashed buffoon! The King is injured! Seek out a healer at once!","story_sia_03_13":"Wow, rude, dude.","story_sia_03_14":"(I had every entry point under maximum surveillance...)","story_sia_03_15":"(...Just who is this girl?)","story_sia_04_name":"Mail Scorched Black","story_sia_04_01":"Nosy Naya, I believe you owe me some explanations.","story_sia_04_02":"Oh, Mrs. Leonel... I believe YOU owe me explanations.","story_sia_04_03":"I beg your pardon?","story_sia_04_04":"I've intercepted some VERY interesting letters. Sent by you, I believe.","story_sia_04_05":"Shall we read it together?","story_sia_04_06":"...!","story_sia_04_07":"Let's see here... A Kern seal, addressed directly to the Kern emperor?","story_sia_04_08":"My, my. I was dearly hoping for a scandalous love affair, but I suppose treason is fine, too.","story_sia_04_09":"N-naya, please stop!","story_sia_04_10":"Oh! Here's a juicy bit!","story_sia_04_11":"\"King Reinhold is a complete fool whose presence on the throne benefits you greatly.\"","story_sia_04_12":"\"Keeping him alive is sure to damage his kingdom even more so than its ruler's death.\"","story_sia_04_13":"...","story_sia_04_14":"Such unkind words are rather unbecoming of his advisor, I would say!","story_sia_04_15":"Nosy... Naya... You'll pay for this!","story_sia_04_16":"Someday, perhaps. But for now, I believe it is you who will pay. Handsomely, I suspect.","story_sia_04_17":"...Stooping so low as to blackmail?","story_sia_04_18":"So small a sin, compared to treason!","story_sia_04_19":"If you had planned harm upon our king, on the other hand...","story_sia_04_20":"Hmph. Very well. Name your price. And pray that my spy network never outsmarts yours, Naya.","story_sia_04_21":"I'm looking forward to it!","story_sia_05_name":"Agent Swan","story_sia_05_01":"\"... In a drastic turn of events, an attempt was made on King Reinhold's life.\"","story_sia_05_02":"\"Azuma seems to be behind this attempt. Agent Swan will investigate further.\"","story_sia_05_03":"Sia! What are you doing?","story_sia_05_04":"Oh, merely writing a letter, pay it no mind.","story_sia_05_05":"(My report to the Kern emperor, that is...)","story_sia_05_06":"Very well! Some foreign dignitaries are awaiting my presence.","story_sia_05_07":"They may be a tad... offended by last time's shopping trip.","story_sia_05_08":"I would very much enjoy your assistance in defusing this situation!","story_sia_05_09":"Of course. I'll be there in a moment, my King.","story_sia_05_10":"Letting the Kern emperor know of this assassination attempt may usher forth dire consequences...","story_sia_05_11":"I... need more time to think. This kingdom is... not yet ready to face Kern.","story_sia_05_12":"For the sake of everyone's safety... I suppose I could omit this detail...","story_sia_05_13":"\"All is going as planned.

A most... generous ruler.","story_sia_07_08":"The <c1>Pure Gold</c1> is then minted into coinage, resulting in a sharp inflation of currency...","story_sia_07_09":"Correct. I see you've been intercepting my mail to the Emperor.","story_sia_07_10":"I do enjoy being in the know.","story_sia_07_11":"Since you're here, make yourself useful and carry some <c1>Pure Gold</c1> back to the castle.","story_sia_07_12":"Of course.

Changing side, if you will.","story_sia_09_06":"And you'll be the one to break the news. And support my story, of course.","story_sia_09_07":"P-preposterous! This is high treason! I would never...","story_sia_09_08":"I believe you will, Donovan. Unless, of course, you'd like the world to learn the recipe of your elixir of immortality?","story_sia_09_09":"Ah, is that the extend of your bluff, Sia? I've never told anyone of this recipe. There is no way-","story_sia_09_10":"What was it again?

I don't think that's necessary.","story_yami_08_06":"...Why not, Gorza?","story_yami_08_07":"A solo expedition to Bleakspire Peaks is suicide. That girl wasn't packing any supplies, either.","story_yami_08_08":"There's no way she doesn't know that. Even Rudo's not stupid enough to go there alone.","story_yami_08_09":"Is that so? Thank you Gorza, I'll take it into consideration.","story_yami_08_10":"I suppose this problem solves itself, but...","story_yami_08_11":"...It leaves a bitter aftertaste.

That looks like pure Celesteel to me.","story_rudo_05_05":"In any case, there is something more at work here, probably magic...","story_rudo_05_06":"OF COURSE it's magic.","story_rudo_05_07":"It's always cursed magic.","story_rudo_05_08":"Seems to me like you already knew this! Why not go to someone learned in such things instead of me?","story_rudo_05_09":"You can't trust mages... Not one bit. My clan knows this.","story_rudo_05_10":"Well I don't think you have a choice here, son.","story_rudo_05_11":"Beside, how could you not trust sweet Lilu to begin with? She's adorable!","story_rudo_05_12":"She a mage ain't she? Means she's just like the rest.","story_rudo_05_13":"Dangerous. Wicked. VILE.","story_rudo_05_14":"Well, she's probably the only one who can help, if you want to get rid of this staff at some point.","story_rudo_05_15":"...Blast it.","story_rudo_a_name":"Tough Love","story_rudo_a_01":"Gorza!","story_rudo_a_02":"Gorza!<sprite tint=1 name=Note2>","story_rudo_a_03":"Hey Juniper. And Maylee! What's up?","story_rudo_a_04":"Me and Maylee were talking about her future prince charming...","story_rudo_a_05":"Oooh I can't wait!","story_rudo_a_06":"...And we were wondering... how did YOU meet yours?","story_rudo_a_07":"That big, dumb oaf Rudo? Hah!","story_rudo_a_08":"He may not look like it, but that man really knows how to talk to a lady.","story_rudo_a_09":"Let's see... it went a bit like this...","story_rudo_a_10":"...Another one, for the road.","story_rudo_a_11":"So... Rudo. Have you ever considered settling down?","story_rudo_a_12":"Mind your business, Naya. I ain't got time for that.","story_rudo_a_13":"Love strikes when you least expect it! Who knows, the woman of your dreams could walk in at any time...","story_rudo_a_14":"Bah! I won't settle for a woman who can't wrestle me to the ground.","story_rudo_a_15":"Is that a challenge, big guy?","story_rudo_a_16":"Try me, tooth face!","story_rudo_a_17":"Gorza, please put the chair down-","story_rudo_a_18":"How about this, meathead? You want some more?","story_rudo_a_19":"RAAAAGH!!!","story_rudo_a_20":"Woah!","story_rudo_a_21":"...And we got married the week after. Bloodiest wedding I've ever seen.","story_rudo_a_22":"...","story_rudo_a_23":"...","story_rudo_a_24":"...M-maybe we should go ask someone else.","story_polonia_00_01":"Ahoy, landlubber.","story_polonia_00_02":"Heard ye were running a business on me turf, all sneaky like.","story_polonia_00_03":"Tough luck, swabbie. Cap'n Polonia has ears everywhere!","story_polonia_00_04":"Cough up a tribute for yer cap'n, or I'll have ye walk the plank!","story_polonia_00_hire_01":"Ahoy, lootkeeper.","story_polonia_00_hire_02":"As of today, I, Captain Polonia, promote ye to first mate!","story_polonia_00_hire_03":"I'll be counting on ye to sniff out lucrative plundering opportunities for yer Cap'n.","story_polonia_00_hire_04":"Welcome aboard, matey!","story_polonia_01_name":"Landlubber Extraordinaire","story_polonia_01_01":"Yo ho ho! Landlubbers!","story_polonia_01_02":"Have ye ever dreamt of daring tales of swashbucklin' and piracy on the high seas?","story_polonia_01_03":"I, Cap'n Polonia Del Monte, be recruiting a crew for me ship!","story_polonia_01_04":"As granddaughter of the legendary pirate Baross Del Monte, I can promise ye booty and adventure!","story_polonia_01_05":"Captain Polonia, was it?","story_polonia_01_06":"Aye. Ye interested? A fine stud like ye would be welcome.","story_polonia_01_07":"S-stud!?","story_polonia_01_08":"Er-hem, not really! I'm Argon, knight-in-training!","story_polonia_01_09":"Piracy is illegal so... please surrender and come peacefully!","story_polonia_01_10":"Shiver me timbers! A blasted knight...","story_polonia_01_11":"Err, ye see, I'm a legal pirate, like that... Robin Hood landlubber.","story_polonia_01_12":"...I steal from the rich and give to the poor!","story_polonia_01_13":"Oh! That does sound rather noble. Fair enough, carry on!","story_polonia_01_14":"...Whew.","story_polonia_01_15":"No luck today either, huh?","story_polonia_01_16":"Arr, life on the high seas be tough.","story_polonia_02_name":"The Tale of Del Monte","story_polonia_02_01":"No more recruiting today, Polonia?","story_polonia_02_02":"It be useless. I be a failure as a pirate captain, let alone bearing the Del Monte name...","story_polonia_02_03":"This Baross Del Monte... your grandfather, was it?","story_polonia_02_04":"Aye! A legend among legends! The modern times be tough for us pirates...","story_polonia_02_05":"All the merchant ships these days carry fancy magical detection tools to easily avoid us sea dogs.","story_polonia_02_06":"But not Baross! Magic or not, he struck undetected from the fog!","story_polonia_02_07":"Robbed them blind of all their valuables, leaving only his echoing laughter as his calling card...","story_polonia_02_08":"Even after every other pirates had retired, he continued to terrorize the seas for decades!","story_polonia_02_09":"That's quite a legacy to live up to!","story_polonia_02_10":"Aye! And after each voyage, he would always find time to visit his granddaughter and regale her with tales of adventure...","story_polonia_02_11":"\"Raise the black flag! Fire the cannons! All men starside, ready to plunder!\"","story_polonia_02_12":"Starside? Isn't it called starboard?","story_polonia_02_13":"...Argh! Blast it all! I'm just a landlubber with a fancy costume, trying too hard to talk like a pirate.","story_polonia_02_14":"What's a pirate without a ship, anyway!?","story_polonia_02_15":"No ship, huh? Maybe you should start there.","story_polonia_02_16":"Huh?","story_polonia_02_17":"A captain without a ship won't be pulling a crew anytime soon!","story_polonia_02_18":"But if a ship is what you need, I think I know the right man for the job.","story_polonia_02_19":"...Really?","story_polonia_02_20":"I mean, by the Jolly Roger, thank ye, tavern lady! Cap'n Polonia owes ye one!","story_polonia_02_21":"Oh believe me, I'm counting on it.","story_polonia_03_name":"Downright Shipwright","story_polonia_03_01":"You want me to build an entire ship!?","story_polonia_03_02":"Aye. Can ye do it?","story_polonia_03_03":"You bet! This will be my masterpiece! Let me see those plans.","story_polonia_03_04":"Hmm... they are quite elaborate. What are these scribbles?","story_polonia_03_05":"Me handwriting. I can't read.","story_polonia_03_06":"Ah, well that explains a few things. Still, these are more than enough.","story_polonia_03_07":"Yo ho ho! It'll be the greatest ship these seas have seen since Baross and Bonaventura!","story_polonia_03_08":"There is the matter of funding, though. Are you sure you can afford this?","story_polonia_03_09":"Aye, dubloons won't be a problem. Craft the ship, I'll bring yer booty.","story_polonia_04_name":"Captain's Share","story_polonia_04_01":"Arr, these Yetis be loaded with loot! I'll be paying for me ship in no time!","story_polonia_04_02":"Alright, dude, I'm here. So what do I do?","story_polonia_04_03":"That's Cap'n Polonia for ye, swabbie!","story_polonia_04_04":"Sure thing, captain dude. What do you want me to do?","story_polonia_04_05":"Ye brought yer cart. Ye carry the booty while I rob these Yetis blind.","story_polonia_04_06":"Wow, captain dude, you steal from these beautiful, furred creatures?","story_polonia_04_07":"Aye. For some reason, they be carrying tons of valuables like Warhammers and Compound Bows.","story_polonia_04_08":"What about the pelts, captain dude? Can I have them?","story_polonia_04_09":"Know yer place, swabbie! Pirates plunder, they don't kill!","story_polonia_04_10":"Oh, that's a waste.","story_polonia_04_11":"Not at all. If ye leave yer victims alive, they gather up more loot ye can plunder later. Basic economics!","story_polonia_04_12":"Now keep up if ye want yer share, swabbie!","story_polonia_04_13":"Aye aye, captain dude.","story_polonia_05_name":"Maiden Voyage","story_polonia_05_01":"Behold, my life's work and masterpiece!","story_polonia_05_02":"It... it be beautiful. Ye brought a tear to this old salt's eye.","story_polonia_05_03":"Isn't it? I had to cut in a few places, namely your strange insistence for cannons atop the crow's nest...","story_polonia_05_04":"But I think it turned out more than fine, don't you think?","story_polonia_05_05":"That it did, matey. Here's yer dubloon, ye earned it.","story_polonia_05_06":"I certainly did! One last thing though. While I may be a master carpenter, cloth and fabric are beyond me.","story_polonia_05_07":"...And without a sail, your ship won't be leaving port anytime soon!","story_polonia_05_08":"Ye've done yer Cap'n proud already, matey. I have a sail right here.","story_polonia_05_09":"Wow! Now that's a work of art! Magical, too! Where did you get that?","story_polonia_05_10":"A heirloom from me grandpappy Baross. The very sail once atop his ship - the Bonaventura!","story_polonia_05_11":"I see! A remarkable finishing touch to this vessel!","story_polonia_05_12":"Well then, Captain Polonia, the Splendid Allan is yours!","story_polonia_05_13":"Ye named her the Splendid Allan? Hold on...","story_polonia_05_14":"That figurehead... it's ye!? And butt naked, too!","story_polonia_05_15":"Hah hah! I can think of no finer figurehead for such a perfect ship!","story_polonia_06_name":"Legacy at Sea","story_polonia_06_01":"My King, I bring dire news.","story_polonia_06_02":"Oh no! Has the Lost City of Gold run out of gold!?","story_polonia_06_03":"Nothing so dire, mercifully.","story_polonia_06_04":"However, I fear a meddlesome pirate has been plundering your personal merchant fleet.","story_polonia_06_05":"...The theft is estimated to be upwards of 100 trillion gold.","story_polonia_06_06":"By the Goddess! What of my fleet's state-of-the-art magical pirate detection?","story_polonia_06_07":"Utterly inefficient, it seems. Much like the great Baross himself, this ship eludes even our best magic...","story_polonia_06_08":"...Plundering your gold before slipping away into the sea.","story_polonia_06_09":"Absolutely barbaric! What of the crew?","story_polonia_06_10":"Spared, my King. So long as they offer no resistance.","story_polonia_06_11":"Gold is a small price to pay then. I shall eat peasant meals until my fortune is restored!","story_polonia_06_12":"...How long will it take?","story_polonia_06_13":"Approximately 2 days, my King.","story_polonia_06_14":"Dark times indeed....","story_polonia_07_name":"Shore Leave","story_polonia_07_01":"Yo ho ho! Captain Polonia be ashore! Rounds be on me!","story_polonia_07_02":"Polonia! Or should I say... Captain Polonia! I take it your \"business\" is going well?","story_polonia_07_03":"Ye bet yer landlubber bottoms it be! These seas be ripe for plunderin'!","story_polonia_07_04":"Wherever me ship goes, me grandpappy's sails catch the wind like nothing I ever seen!","story_polonia_07_05":"I'm sure Baross would be proud. How do you intend to spend these... ill-gotten goods?","story_polonia_07_06":"Like any good pirate. Buried it here and there with me crew.","story_polonia_07_07":"Oooh! Treasure maps! How exciting!","story_polonia_07_08":"Aye, that's how pirates be. Keep some for ye cold winter months, like them squirrel landlubbers.","story_polonia_07_09":"And what about the rest?","story_polonia_07_10":"Gave it to the pretty temple lady.","story_polonia_07_11":"An orphanage donation? I did not take you for the charitable type.","story_polonia_07_12":"Orpha what?","story_polonia_07_13":"Ah, never mind. So what can I get you, Captain?","story_polonia_07_14":"Me favorite; Old Salt's Brew! And to any landlubber who think they can hold it down...","story_polonia_07_15":"Next round's on me! The Baross family is back at sea! Yo ho ho!","story_polonia_a_name":"Getting a Leg Up","story_polonia_a_01":"Ahoy, pretty lady. Yer a healer, aren't ye?","story_polonia_a_02":"Ah, yes! I am Freyja, priestess of this tem-","story_polonia_a_03":"Chop me leg off.","story_polonia_a_04":"Excuse me?","story_polonia_a_05":"I asked ye to chop me leg off!","story_polonia_a_06":"Goodness gracious, no! Why would anyone ever want this?","story_polonia_a_07":"I be a pirate! What kind of pirate cap'n doesn't have a blasted peg leg!?","story_polonia_a_08":"Just chop me leg off and stitch it up with yer fancy magic!","story_polonia_a_09":"Absolutely not. I've sworn an oath to the Goddess never to harm a human being.","story_polonia_a_10":"Argh, useless landlubbers! Fine! But ye won't be gettin' any of me dubloons!","story_polonia_a_11":"...What a strange girl.","story_polonia_b_name":"Leg It!","story_polonia_b_01":"Ahoy, ye there.","story_polonia_b_02":"Yeah?","story_polonia_b_03":"Chop me leg off.","story_polonia_b_04":"Sure.","story_polonia_b_05":"I said- wait, yer ok with this?","story_polonia_b_06":"Yeah, sure. Just hold your leg out like this. This old axe should do the trick.","story_polonia_b_07":"Err, hold on!","story_polonia_b_08":"It won't be pretty, but you're a tough girl, aren't you?","story_polonia_b_09":"Just make sure to apply a good tourniquet. Wouldn't want you bleeding out, now.","story_polonia_b_10":"Avast, matey! Slow down!","story_polonia_b_11":"I- me ship's sailing soon! I-I gotta go catch it! See ya, matey!","story_polonia_b_12":"...Hah! Humans. Never a dull moment.","story_donovan_00_01":"Greetings, esteemed shopkeeper.","story_donovan_00_02":"You're quite the economic force around these parts. I've heard a great deal about you.","story_donovan_00_03":"Ah, but how rude of me! I am Donovan, Imperial Alchemist of Kern.","story_donovan_00_04":"I believe this is the beginning of a great partnership, wouldn't you agree?","story_donovan_00_hire_01":"Ah, excellent timing! My vacation was growing dull.","story_donovan_00_hire_02":"Your Heroes will be glad to have me at their side, I'm sure of it.","story_donovan_00_hire_03":"I have a knack for bringing out the best in everything, be they ingredients or warriors.","story_donovan_00_hire_04":"My skills and knowledge are at your service, esteemed shopkeeper.","story_donovan_01_name":"Original Recipe","story_donovan_01_01":"Welcome to the Maribel Medicine Emporium! How can I help you?","story_donovan_01_02":"Lady Maribel, was it? I would like to personally commend your latest creation.","story_donovan_01_03":"As the inventor of the Potion of Renewal, your modified blueprint is nothing short of genius!","story_donovan_01_04":"The simple addition of a dash of Mistpeak Bloom is a terrific improvement!","story_donovan_01_05":"Wait a minute... you mean you're THE Donovan? No way!","story_donovan_01_06":"The Potion of Renewal blueprint was invented roughly 700 years ago...","story_donovan_01_07":"Even as an elf, you don't look a day over 150!","story_donovan_01_08":"You are too kind, Lady Maribel.","story_donovan_01_09":"Let's just say that not all of my blueprints are commercially available...","story_donovan_01_10":"But I'm certain a master alchemist such as yourself would have no trouble learning them.","story_donovan_01_11":"Now then, shall I take a look at some of that Mistpeak Bloom?","story_donovan_02_name":"Land of Plenty","story_donovan_02_01":"Fascinating... Even the common apples around these parts are of excellent quality.","story_donovan_02_02":"How could this be, I wonder...?","story_donovan_02_03":"If someone could explain it, it would be Juniper!","story_donovan_02_04":"Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to intrude in your conversation with that... tree.","story_donovan_02_05":"Ah, a young lady in a broad brimmed hat and her loyal owl...","story_donovan_02_06":"You must be Miss Lilu, no doubt.","story_donovan_02_07":"That's right! And you, Sir Donovan, obviously need no introduction!","story_donovan_02_08":"I've heard much about the prized young pupil of this city. The pleasure is all mine.","story_donovan_02_09":"Now then, Miss Lilu. You were saying...?","story_donovan_02_10":"Oh yes! Juniper is always talking about how much the land around the city is teeming with life...","story_donovan_02_11":"It's part of the reason she enjoys gardening here so much, she says.","story_donovan_02_12":"In any case, I was on my way to the Aurora Caves. Nice meeting you, Sir Donovan!","story_donovan_02_13":"May we meet again soon.","story_donovan_02_14":"Hmm... Perhaps this young lady is onto something...","story_donovan_02_15":"Kern... depleted? Everything seems much more vibrant in this kingdom.","story_donovan_02_16":"I should pay a visit to this gardener. If ingredients are more potent here...","story_donovan_02_17":"...Then it is something I must exploit.","story_donovan_03_name":"Behind the Mask","story_donovan_03_01":"You called for me, Miss Sia?","story_donovan_03_02":"Ah, Lilu. Thank you for coming on such short notice.","story_donovan_03_03":"...I believe you've already acquainted yourself with Donovan?","story_donovan_03_04":"Oh, yes! He's a legend among alchemists! I'm so glad I got to meet him!","story_donovan_03_05":"Approach that man with extreme caution.","story_donovan_03_06":"H-huh!? But he's such a gentleman! Very knowledgeable, too...","story_donovan_03_07":"Appearances can be deceiving. Behind his youthful facade lies a cunning, millennia old mastermind.","story_donovan_03_08":"Millennia!? That's unheard of, even for elves! Do you think...","story_donovan_03_09":"Yes. Some believe he may have discovered a sort of elixir of immortality.","story_donovan_03_10":"Wow! I wouldn't mind adding that recipe to my grimoire!","story_donovan_03_11":"As would many rulers. I suspect he may have the Kern emperor dancing to his tune.","story_donovan_03_12":"...Politics sure are complicated.","story_donovan_03_13":"But thanks! I'll be careful around him!","story_donovan_03_14":"I knew you would understand.","story_donovan_03_15":"As for me, I'll make sure to keep him away from our... impressionable king.","story_donovan_03_16":"Yeah... that's probably for the best.","story_donovan_a_name":"Ten Gold's a Steal","story_donovan_a_01":"Hey, potion dude. You got a sec'?","story_donovan_a_02":"Ugh... vagabonds.","story_donovan_a_03":"To whom do I owe this... pleasure?","story_donovan_a_04":"I'm Tamas, the leather guy.","story_donovan_a_05":"Heard you could fix up a cool elixir of immortality, dude. Can I get a bottle?","story_donovan_a_06":"...I have no idea where you've caught wind of this rumor.","story_donovan_a_07":"Even if it were true, you can be certain I would not be giving away something so valuable.","story_donovan_a_08":"I'll give you ten gold for it.","story_donovan_a_09":"Absolutely NOT. Wars have been fought over this recipe! Emperors all over the world beg for a mere taste!","story_donovan_a_10":"You drive a hard bargain, dude. Fifteen gold, final offer.","story_donovan_a_11":"Has the smell of leather addled your brain, vagrant? I would not part with this recipe for all the gold in the world!","story_donovan_a_12":"I must be off. Please never speak to me again.","story_donovan_a_13":"Dang, I almost had it.","story_donovan_a_14":"...Guess I'll have to find another treat for those sheep.","story_hemma_00_01":"Well well...","story_hemma_00_02":"From what we gathered, you are the one to talk to when we need something done around these parts...","story_hemma_00_03":"Do not ask too many questions, and we can make it worth your while. ","story_hemma_00_hire_01":"Fantastic.","story_hemma_00_hire_02":"You will not be disappointed with us.","story_hemma_00_hire_03":"Our powers, combined with sturdy companions, are formidable.","story_hemma_00_hire_04":"The results will speak for themselves, we are sure of it.","story_hemma_01_name":"Looming Shadow","story_hemma_01_01":"...And so the Troublin fell, but not before landing some blows on my companions.","story_hemma_01_02":"Please see to it that they are healed.","story_hemma_01_03":"But of course. I will tend to their wounds posthaste.","story_hemma_01_04":"Hi! I heard there was a new spellcaster in town.","story_hemma_01_05":"I'm Lilu! Pleased to make your acquaintance!","story_hemma_01_06":"You are correct, young Lilu. Our name is Hemma. ","story_hemma_01_07":"...\"Our\"?","story_hemma_01_08":"...Yes. Necromancy takes a toll on its practitioners...","story_hemma_01_09":"A part of you stays across the Veil, while other things cross the threshold...","story_hemma_01_10":"These powers... changed us. For the best, of course.","story_hemma_01_11":"Necromancy, you say!? Isn't that... dangerous?","story_hemma_01_12":"Incredibly so. But we are not satisfied with simple tricks anymore.","story_hemma_01_13":"Now, if you'll excuse us, we need to be elsewhere. Farewell.","story_hemma_01_14":"A necromancer... That is some pretty dark magic, Pollux! But it's the first time I can see a practitioner for real!","story_hemma_01_15":"She didn't seem so bad... Did she?","story_hemma_02_name":"At Any Cost","story_hemma_02_01":"A necromancer...?","story_hemma_02_02":"I'm not sure what to make of all this...","story_hemma_02_03":"You are right to worry. Necromancy is a dangerous art that would consume lesser beings...","story_hemma_02_04":"But we are not lesser in any way.","story_hemma_02_05":"What about the adventurers that go with you? Do you not drain them to empower your spells?","story_hemma_02_06":"Only with their consent. The effects are not permanent.","story_hemma_02_07":"And we do pay them handsomely for their services.","story_hemma_02_08":"I suppose you are doing some good after all...","story_hemma_02_09":"Very well. I suppose you can be a sanctioned Champion of our city.","story_hemma_02_10":"We did not need your approval... but we thank you.","story_hemma_02_11":"So what brought you here to our city?","story_hemma_02_12":"...","story_hemma_02_13":"We simply seek knowledge and power. ","story_hemma_02_14":"There is... a task we must do.","story_hemma_02_15":"How very vague...","story_hemma_02_16":"And it will stay this way. Farewell.","story_hemma_02_17":"...","story_hemma_02_18":"There is much sadness in those eyes...","story_hemma_03_name":"The Enemy Within","story_hemma_03_01":"...Unripe Living Roots, and an extra chunky Spooky Ectoplasm. Anything else?","story_hemma_03_02":"That will be all. We shall visit the shopkeeper for the rest.","story_hemma_03_03":"Thank you, come again!","story_hemma_03_04":"<c4>...Don't forget the Grim Talons.</c4>","story_hemma_03_05":"Ah, yes. A pair of Grim Talons, please.","story_hemma_03_06":"...What was THAT just now?","story_hemma_03_07":"Pay it no mind. A mere passenger, if you will.","story_hemma_03_08":"<c4>Let-me-out-let-me-out-let-me-out-let-me-out.</c4>","story_hemma_03_09":"Ugh. Settle down, will you?","story_hemma_03_10":"You may keep the change. Farewell.","story_hemma_03_11":"...Thanks for the tip... and the nightmares.","story_hemma_04_name":"Exorcism","story_hemma_04_01":"Don't worry, Hemma. I'm here! I brought Freyja!","story_hemma_04_02":"Hemma, was it? Please relax. Let the exorcism flow through you...","story_hemma_04_03":"We don't recall asking for your assistance.","story_hemma_04_04":"<c4>Beat it, kids. I ain't going anywhere.</c4>","story_hemma_04_05":"Aaaah! It's taking over! Quick, Freyja!","story_hemma_04_06":"I... can't! Something's blocking my prayers...","story_hemma_04_07":"We are. Stop that.","story_hemma_04_08":"Are you... willingly hosting this malevolent spirit!?","story_hemma_04_09":"He has gone a bit mad over time, I admit.","story_hemma_04_10":"<c4>I'm the victim here! Let me out!</c4>","story_hemma_04_11":"Ugh. More rude than malevolent, I can assure you.","story_hemma_04_12":"This matter does not concern you. Please do not get involved, Freyja.","story_hemma_04_13":"Those necromancers... always toying with powers they don't understand!","story_hemma_04_14":"It's OK Freyja! I'm sure she knows what she's doing!","story_hemma_04_15":"...Right?","story_hemma_05_name":"She of Two Minds","story_hemma_05_01":"<c4>Looks like the cat's out of the bag again. Ready to leave town?</c4>","story_hemma_05_02":"YOU did this. If you could keep quiet, things would be a lot easier.","story_hemma_05_03":"Regardless, we're not leaving yet. This town shows promise.","story_hemma_05_04":"<c4>Fine. How about letting me out for once?</c4>","story_hemma_05_05":"A-absolutely not. You're hard enough to keep under control as it is.","story_hemma_05_06":"<c4>Let-me-out-let-me-out-let-me-out-let-me-out.</c4>","story_hemma_05_07":"I'm doing this for your sake, Claud.","story_hemma_05_08":"...Please remember that.","story_hemma_06_name":"Legacy of Lies","story_hemma_06_01":"Fairlyn!","story_hemma_06_02":"Yes?","story_hemma_06_03":"I knew it! Hemma's just a fake name! You're the monster, Fairlyn!","story_hemma_06_04":"Oh my. What a devious little trickster we have here.","story_hemma_06_05":"It's true. It seems you've done your homework.","story_hemma_06_06":"Perhaps you've also heard of Ariel the Mad? Or Astrid the Fallen?","story_hemma_06_07":"...I read about them... but they vanished decades ago! They can't be...","story_hemma_06_08":"All us, of course. Unfortunately we face much persecution, and names must be discarded...","story_hemma_06_09":"You're a monster! You must be stopped!","story_hemma_06_10":"And how do you intend to do that? \"Hemma\" is innocent. Who would believe this wild tale of yours?","story_hemma_06_11":"Unless, of course, you intend to stop me by yourself...","story_hemma_06_12":"...Hmph!","story_hemma_07_name":"Soul Splice","story_hemma_07_01":"Still skulking about?","story_hemma_07_02":"I'm keeping an eye on you. You and your suspicious monologues...","story_hemma_07_03":"Ah, yes. Meet Claud, our husband. He's seen better days.","story_hemma_07_04":"<c4>I want out!</c4>","story_hemma_07_05":"...What happened to him?","story_hemma_07_06":"A terrible necromantic accident. A foolish mistake left him on the brink of death.","story_hemma_07_07":"Given our sins on this earth, the afterlife is a terrifying prospect for us necromancers...","story_hemma_07_08":"Unable to save his body, we did the best we could... and saved his soul.","story_hemma_07_09":"A Soul Splice? This spell requires years of research to prepare an appropriate vessel...","story_hemma_07_10":"Indeed. Given the circumstances, we improvised.","story_hemma_07_11":"Improvised? You don't mean... you bound Claud's soul to yourself!?","story_hemma_07_12":"A body can't support two souls! It would cause-","story_hemma_07_13":"Mind-shattering pain. Insanity. Worse than you can possibly imagine.","story_hemma_07_14":"Hemma... Why...? How...?","story_hemma_07_15":"It is simple, little Lilu. Failure... is not an option.","story_hemma_08_name":"A Century's Bounty","story_hemma_08_01":"Too powerful to exorcise... maybe the soul could be bound to something else...?","story_hemma_08_02":"You're awfully cooperative. Have you developed an interest in necromancy?","story_hemma_08_03":"No! I hate you and everything you've done!","story_hemma_08_04":"...The way I see it, if that Claud guy breaks free, it'll be big trouble for everyone here.","story_hemma_08_05":"I'm helping you fix this mess, and nothing more!","story_hemma_08_06":"A noble sentiment. But how could a mere child be of any help?","story_hemma_08_07":"Preparing a proper vessel would require decades of research and materials...","story_hemma_08_08":"That will not be an issue. Behold.","story_hemma_08_09":"...! How did you get all this...? Even Black Diamonds!","story_hemma_08_10":"These past decades were not wasted. Our time runs short.","story_hemma_08_11":"What is left is a proper location to conduct the ritual. We fear such a place may not exist.","story_hemma_08_12":"Right. The soul needs a spiritual attachment to the area, or the binding will fail.","story_hemma_08_13":"<c4>Or you could just let good ol' Claud Favius run free! He'll make lots of friends!</c4>","story_hemma_08_14":"Wait... did you say Favius?","story_hemma_09_name":"The Haunted Castle","story_hemma_09_01":"What a delightfully haunted place.","story_hemma_09_02":"It's an awful place. No sane person should ever come here.","story_hemma_09_03":"But most importantly, according to my research...","story_hemma_09_04":"...A mad king from the Favius family used to rule here, centuries ago.","story_hemma_09_05":"Maybe Claud is a distant relative? Hopefully he didn't have anything to do with that kingdom's ruin...","story_hemma_09_06":"...We can feel it. We are connected to this place. This is it.","story_hemma_09_07":"We owe you a great debt, Lilu. But now you must leave us be.","story_hemma_09_08":"Hemma... Good luck.","story_hemma_10_name":"Till Death Do Us Part","story_hemma_10_01":"A dark, haunted and secluded place, brimming with necromantic energy...","story_hemma_10_02":"How long have we searched for such a place?","story_hemma_10_03":"Now to find a suitable vessel...","story_hemma_10_04":"There is no need to speak. We know exactly what you wish.","story_hemma_10_05":"...","story_hemma_10_06":"...The armor of the mad king himself, forever bound to this place.","story_hemma_10_07":"<c1>Soul Splice!</c1>","story_hemma_10_08":"...","story_hemma_10_09":"Ugh... We feel... or I...?","story_hemma_10_10":"I had forgotten this feeling of solitude...","story_hemma_10_11":"I've suffered an eternity to save you, dear. Because I know you would've done exactly the same.","story_hemma_10_12":"Brave adventurers will surely come. Fight them, and through carnage, heal your tortured existence.","story_hemma_10_13":"...","story_hemma_10_14":"Farewell, beloved. But only in death shall we truly part.","story_hemma_epilogue_name":"Epilogue","story_hemma_epilogue_01":"<c4>FOOOLS!!!

We must retreat!","story_hemma_epilogue_05":"Never! I'm not giving him an inch!","story_hemma_epilogue_06":"I found an exit. Hurry!","story_hemma_epilogue_07":"Bah! I'll be back, you big tin can!

Interesting choice.","story_hemma_a_02":"What of it?","story_hemma_a_03":"Living Roots are potent reagants for many magics related to youth and lifespan.","story_hemma_a_04":"Might you be a fellow alchemist? A quest for longevity, perhaps?","story_hemma_a_05":"...You would ask a lady her age? How... unbecoming.","story_hemma_a_06":"We are no alchemist. Blood sacrifices are much more efficient.","story_hemma_a_07":"Ah, necromancy! A respectable, but misunderstood field.","story_hemma_a_08":"As for our age... we stopped counting quite a while ago.","story_hemma_a_09":"I can definitely relate. Decades just seem to fly by after the first few centuries!","story_hemma_a_10":"It gets lonely among all these mayflies, doesn't it?","story_hemma_a_11":"Lonely, we are not. You would do well not to pry in a Necromancer's business.","story_hemma_a_12":"Of course. I would not wish to intrude. Farewell!","story_hemma_a_13":"Strange necromancer... Have we met before?","story_hemma_a_14":"...Fairlyn?","story_ashley_00_01":"Oi, I'm new in town. You know a good place for a Samurai to crash?","story_ashley_00_02":"Emerald Inn? That'll do.","story_ashley_00_03":"Name's uh... Ashley. Yeah. That's my name.","story_ashley_00_04":"Since I'm here, I might as well grab something, yeah?","story_ashley_00_hire_01":"Think I'll be sticking around for a bit longer. It's getting a bit boring, though.","story_ashley_00_hire_02":"How about sending me on a quest, boss? The toughest one you got.","story_ashley_00_hire_03":"Send me out to die, and I'll come back stronger.","story_ashley_00_hire_04":"Heh. That sounded pretty cool, yeah?","story_ashley_01_name":"The Unusual Samurai","story_ashley_01_01":"A real Samurai...! I can't wait!","story_ashley_01_02":"Lady Samurai! I'm Argon!

Alright.","story_ashley_01_07":"Well? What'd you need?","story_ashley_01_08":"Uh... aren't Samurai usually more like, orderly and stuff?","story_ashley_01_09":"Huh? Yeah, the guys back home were pretty stuffy about it.","story_ashley_01_10":"I'm free now. Just a Ronin. A Samurai without a lord.","story_ashley_01_11":"I see... Oh, right!","story_ashley_01_12":"I had a quest planned with Lilu at the Haunted Castle but...","story_ashley_01_13":"Something came up at the Training Hall!

Pleased to meet you!","story_ashley_02_03":"Right then, let's get going.","story_ashley_02_04":"W-wait! Hold on!","story_ashley_02_05":"We still haven't made preparations!

That's too reckless!","story_ashley_02_09":"I'm going. This way, right?","story_ashley_02_10":"No! That's the Howling Woods...","story_ashley_02_11":"Um... Good luck?","story_ashley_03_name":"Life's Edge","story_ashley_03_01":"Is that all you monsters got? BRING IT!","story_ashley_03_02":"Ashley! Please slow down!

I'm afraid that-","story_ashley_a_08":"Yikes, that's one ugly bird!","story_ashley_a_09":"I'll call you <c1>Sparrow</c1>. You can come too.","story_ashley_a_10":"...I see. Have fun, you all.","story_bjorn_00_01":"Would you look at that! An entire shop sprouted while I was gone!","story_bjorn_00_02":"It looks like you've made good friends with Brom and Gorza, too! That makes me glad!","story_bjorn_00_03":"What d'you think, Bamham? Tusky, right?","story_bjorn_00_04":"I think Bamham likes you, city dweller.

Dad's home!","story_bjorn_01_02":"Dad!","story_bjorn_01_03":"...Dad.","story_bjorn_01_04":"What's with the long face, Gorza?","story_bjorn_01_05":"You've been gone for months!","story_bjorn_01_06":"That's the Ranger's life! The great outdoors, far away from home.","story_bjorn_01_07":"Pfft. It wouldn't hurt to stop by more often.","story_bjorn_01_08":"I wish I could, but the Cinderlake Volcano tends to keep a man busy!","story_bjorn_01_09":"The Volcano? I thought you said you were investigating Bleakspire Peaks...","story_bjorn_01_10":"...Did I?","story_bjorn_01_11":"I guess I got it mixed up! Har har!","story_bjorn_01_12":"Anyway, I brought souvenirs for you two! Come take a look!","story_bjorn_01_13":"Oh! I hope there's a Crushy Plushie!","story_bjorn_02_name":"Bjorn's Grocery Run","story_bjorn_02_01":"Thanks for the warm welcome, everyone! It's good to be back!","story_bjorn_02_02":"We are relieved to see you return safely. After you'd been gone for months, we feared the worst...","story_bjorn_02_03":"Sorry, sorry! That's just how the Ranger's life tends to be! Har har!","story_bjorn_02_04":"Knowing you, you must already be thinking about your next expedition!","story_bjorn_02_05":"Har har! You got me! We've leaving tomorrow at dawn, even!","story_bjorn_02_06":"Never change, Bjorn. I'll be sure to watch over Brohm and Gorza while you're gone.","story_bjorn_02_07":"...If it's on the way, would you mind gathering a few Glow Shrooms for me?","story_bjorn_02_08":"Of course not! It's no trouble at all!","story_bjorn_02_09":"Oh... my back's been acting up lately. If you could find some Icy Pearls...?","story_bjorn_02_10":"It's barely a detour. I'll be on the lookout , Elder.","story_bjorn_02_11":"Oh! Bjorn! I'd like some Rustwyrm Scales for my next experiment, if you're able!","story_bjorn_02_12":"Of course, of course. Noted!","story_bjorn_02_13":"Whew...! Guess we'd better pack extra bags, Bamham!","story_bjorn_03_name":"All That Litters is Gold","story_bjorn_03_01":"Hmm... You smell what I'm smelling, Bamham?","story_bjorn_03_02":"That's right, metal. Littering, most likely. C'mon Bam, find and fetch it!","story_bjorn_03_03":"Good boy, let me see here...","story_bjorn_03_04":"Huh. That's a strange device. I don't think it was left behind by accident...","story_bjorn_03_05":"Bet you that if I pull that crank here a bit...","story_bjorn_03_06":"Hmm... yes, exactly as I suspected.","story_bjorn_03_07":"...It breaks. I guess we didn't learn that much, did we? Har har!","story_bjorn_03_08":"But I think we've got our lead. We've been looking around for months, and this thing wasn't there last time.","story_bjorn_03_09":"Better head back and ask a pro. You know I'm no good with technology!","story_bjorn_04_name":"Unknown Beacon","story_bjorn_04_01":"What a strange piece! I've never seen anything like it.","story_bjorn_04_02":"It seems to combine both magic and science to act as some sort of... beacon? Radar?","story_bjorn_04_03":"You said it was broken when you found it?","story_bjorn_04_04":"Yeah. What a stroke of bad luck, right? Har har!","story_bjorn_04_05":"That's a shame. I can't really say more other than this: it definitely sends out some kind of information.","story_bjorn_04_06":"Tell you what, if you give me a minute, I can make you a device to help you find more of these... \"Magic Beacons\".","story_bjorn_04_07":"Great! You ready to head back out there, Bamham?","story_bjorn_04_08":"We don't know what these things are... but it can't be good.","story_bjorn_04_09":"It's our job to find out who's behind this!","story_bjorn_04_10":"Good luck! And... be careful when handling mysterious technology!","story_bjorn_a_name":"Best Bud Bamham","story_bjorn_a_01":"Hey kids, you mind watching over Bamham for a bit?","story_bjorn_a_02":"That nasty boar? Not a chance. Keep him with you.","story_bjorn_a_03":"No offense dad, but he's kind of... crazy?","story_bjorn_a_04":"Aw, don't say that! He's cute as a button!","story_bjorn_a_05":"Dad, he goes on a murderous rampage whenever you set him down.","story_bjorn_a_06":"That time was an accident. He just got a lil' bit too excited.","story_bjorn_a_07":"What about all the other times?","story_bjorn_a_08":"Those were... also accidents. Baby Bamham wouldn't hurt a fly!","story_bjorn_a_09":"He would, and he'd definitely enjoy it too.","story_bjorn_a_10":"Look, dad, you're better off carrying that thing with you when you're in town.","story_bjorn_a_11":"...For everyone's safety.","story_bjorn_a_12":"Alright, alright. I get it. It's ok Bamham, I love you.","story_bjorn_a_13":"Woah woah woah! Steady Bamham!","story_atlab_aang_00_01":"Hi! Are you the shopkeeper here?","story_atlab_aang_00_02":"This entire shop is yours? Wow!","story_atlab_aang_00_03":"Oh, sorry! I'm Aang, the Avatar!","story_atlab_aang_00_04":"Me and my friends were riding on my sky bison, but I think we took a wrong turn somewhere...","story_atlab_aang_00_05":"...Hey, those things look interesting! How much for them?","story_atlab_aang_00_hire_01":"We'll be staying here for some time. My bison Appa needs to rest...","story_atlab_aang_00_hire_02":"But the nice man over at the Emerald Inn told me we could stay for free if we helped you out!","story_atlab_aang_00_hire_03":"I'm looking forward to it! I'm sure Sokka will help too, if you can find him!","story_atlab_aang_farewell_01":"Shopkeeper! Appa's all rested up!","story_atlab_aang_farewell_02":"So... I guess it's time for farewells...","story_atlab_aang_farewell_03":"Hey, cheer up! We can come back anytime!","story_atlab_aang_farewell_04":"You're right! Do you remember the way, Sokka?","story_atlab_aang_farewell_05":"Uh... I wasn't paying attention...","story_atlab_aang_farewell_06":"A-anyway! We've got super important Avatar business to get back to!","story_atlab_aang_farewell_07":"C'mon Momo! We're leaving!","story_atlab_aang_farewell_08":"Momo! ...Momo?","story_atlab_aang_farewell_09":"You like it here, don't you? All right, fine.","story_atlab_aang_farewell_10":"Shopkeeper, would you mind keeping an eye on Momo for a while?","story_atlab_aang_farewell_11":"I'll come back for you later, Momo. Promise!","story_atlab_aang_farewell_12":"Let's go, Sokka. Thanks for everything, Shopkeeper!","story_atlab_aang_farewell_13":"Bye!","story_atlab_aang_farewell_14":"Come on, Appa! Yip yip!","story_atlab_aang_01_name":"Fated Wrong Turn","story_atlab_aang_01_01":"Sorry kid, I didn't get all that. Mind repeating your story from the start?","story_atlab_aang_01_02":"Sorry! Let me start over!","story_atlab_aang_01_03":"I'm Aang, the Avatar.","story_atlab_aang_01_04":"Me and my friends were traveling on my sky bison...","story_atlab_aang_01_05":"While flying, we must've taken a wrong turn, because we ended up here!","story_atlab_aang_01_06":"That huge ox outside? That thing flies?","story_atlab_aang_01_07":"Yes! His name is Appa. He's very friendly!","story_atlab_aang_01_08":"Looks pretty exhausted, too. You guys are being chased by someone, right?","story_atlab_aang_01_09":"Oh, um...","story_atlab_aang_01_10":"Hey, don't worry about it. I won't let anyone under my roof come to harm. Oscar's promise.","story_atlab_aang_01_11":"Tell you what, how would you guys like to stay here for free?","story_atlab_aang_01_12":"For free? Really!?","story_atlab_aang_01_13":"Well for starters, it doesn't look like that weird money of yours will be worth anything here.","story_atlab_aang_01_14":"I can't just let a bunch of kids sleep out in the streets now, can I?","story_atlab_aang_01_15":"T-thank you Mr. Oscar!","story_atlab_aang_01_16":"You look pretty capable, how about you go help my shopkeeper buddy in exchange?","story_atlab_aang_01_17":"Sure thing! Thank you so much!","story_atlab_aang_02_name":"Firebending?","story_atlab_aang_02_01":"Hey, Lilu! Come meet my new buddy here!","story_atlab_aang_02_02":"Hi! I've never seen tattoos like yours before...","story_atlab_aang_02_03":"I'm Aang! I've never seen a hat like yours, either!","story_atlab_aang_02_04":"C'mon Aang, show her your trick!","story_atlab_aang_02_05":"You mean... this?","story_atlab_aang_02_06":"H-how did you do that? I didn't sense any magic!","story_atlab_aang_02_07":"Airbending! I can also bend earth and water!","story_atlab_aang_02_08":"Incredible! Hang on, let me take notes...","story_atlab_aang_02_09":"Could it be Chi? I've never seen anyone do this before...","story_atlab_aang_02_10":"That's right! But not anyone can do it, you need to be born with the ability and learn to master it!","story_atlab_aang_02_11":"You said you could bend air, earth and water... what about fire?","story_atlab_aang_02_12":"Ah... I... I haven't mastered firebending yet...","story_atlab_aang_02_13":"...I've had problems finding a firebending master to teach me.","story_atlab_aang_02_14":"Is that so? I know some fire magic!","story_atlab_aang_02_15":"It's not quite the same, but you might like to see how it works!","story_atlab_aang_02_16":"Ah... sure. Thanks, Lilu.","story_atlab_aang_03_name":"The Last Airbender","story_atlab_aang_03_01":"Aang, my boy. How are you liking the city life?","story_atlab_aang_03_02":"Elder Owen! It's great! Thank you for your hospitality.","story_atlab_aang_03_03":"It is nothing. But tell me, my boy, where are your parents?","story_atlab_aang_03_04":"Ah...

My condolences, poor child....","story_atlab_aang_03_08":"...If you have nowhere to return to, how about settling here with your friends?","story_atlab_aang_03_09":"I'm certain the city would be overjoyed to have you stay. You're quite popular already!","story_atlab_aang_03_10":"Thank you for the generous offer, Elder... but I can't accept.","story_atlab_aang_03_11":"As we speak, Fire Lord Ozai is already planning his next move.","story_atlab_aang_03_12":"When Sozin's Comet lights the sky again, the Fire Nation will conquer my world...","story_atlab_aang_03_13":"...The Earth Kingdom... the Water Tribes...

I'll pass!","story_atlab_aang_04_05":"You, who is many, yet not quite whole...","story_atlab_aang_04_06":"A fierce battle with the Lord of Fire awaits.","story_atlab_aang_04_07":"Fire Lord Ozai... You know about him?","story_atlab_aang_04_08":"Under the Comet's gaze, land will be torn asunder, and the fields will be burned to ashes!","story_atlab_aang_04_09":"I know that! But what should I do?","story_atlab_aang_04_10":"The flow of fate cannot be broken.","story_atlab_aang_04_11":"...","story_atlab_aang_04_12":"...But the brave can pull at the strings, and lead it astray.","story_atlab_aang_04_13":"An unlikely ally and a fragile alliance may be the key.","story_atlab_aang_04_14":"Thanks, fortune teller... I'll think about it.","story_atlab_aang_04_15":"...","story_atlab_aang_04_16":"Be brave, Avatar. Stay true to yourself, and you shall overcome.","story_atlab_sokka_00_01":"Wow, Aang wasn't kidding! This shop is loaded!","story_atlab_sokka_00_02":"Maces, swords, spears...","story_atlab_sokka_00_03":"Shopkeeper, I can tell you and I are going to be great friends.","story_atlab_sokka_00_04":"If you give me a good price for these, of course.","story_atlab_sokka_00_hire_01":"Welcome to Team Avatar, shopkeeper.","story_atlab_sokka_00_hire_02":"As the new member of the team, you'll need to cut us some great deals!","story_atlab_sokka_00_hire_03":"Ah, I guess I can go gather materials for you every now and then.","story_atlab_sokka_00_hire_04":"But I need to keep an eye on Aang, alright?","story_atlab_sokka_01_name":"Great Warrior Sokka","story_atlab_sokka_01_01":"And how about... this!","story_atlab_sokka_01_02":"Oh, that's a cute trick!","story_atlab_sokka_01_03":"Ugh. He does that all the time!","story_atlab_sokka_01_04":"Hi, Sokka right? I'm Argon!","story_atlab_sokka_01_05":"Oh, hey. If you want bending tricks, you're looking for Aang.","story_atlab_sokka_01_06":"Oh, no. I don't know much about magic. Or bending.","story_atlab_sokka_01_07":"Judging from your gear, you looked to be a fearsome warrior.","story_atlab_sokka_01_08":"F-fearsome warrior?","story_atlab_sokka_01_09":"W-well you'd be right! I'm Sokka, the Great Warrior of Team Avatar!","story_atlab_sokka_01_10":"I knew it! You must have some incredible tales to tell!","story_atlab_sokka_01_11":"You bet! For example, during the siege of Agna Qel'a...","story_atlab_sokka_01_12":"And that's how my girlfriend, at the time, became the moon.","story_atlab_sokka_01_13":"T-the moon!?","story_atlab_sokka_01_14":"Yeah. But then, the Fire Nation fleet...","story_atlab_sokka_01_15":"...and bang! I knocked out that giant owl guy in the library.","story_atlab_sokka_01_16":"Wow! Wasn't that owl a powerful spirit?","story_atlab_sokka_01_17":"That's right! But Team Avatar is always victorious with Sokka around!","story_atlab_sokka_01_18":"...Speaking of that, where's Aang?","story_atlab_sokka_01_19":"Oh, he left about an hour ago.","story_atlab_sokka_01_20":"Dang! I completely lost track of time. Sorry Argon, gotta run!","story_atlab_sokka_02_name":"Great Smith Sokka","story_atlab_sokka_02_01":"Hard at work, Sokka?","story_atlab_sokka_02_02":"Hey, Wallace. Thanks for letting me use your tools!","story_atlab_sokka_02_03":"No problem! I didn't expect you to be such a craftsman at your age!","story_atlab_sokka_02_04":"When you're the only non-bender in the group, you gotta pick up all sorts of skills.","story_atlab_sokka_02_05":"It's not every day I get to use great tools like these...","story_atlab_sokka_02_06":"Maintenance will be done in a flash!","story_atlab_sokka_02_07":"That sword you're sharpening... where did you get that?","story_atlab_sokka_02_08":"That's my Space Sword!

There's no other sword like it!","story_atlab_sokka_02_12":"Ahoy! Sorry to interrupt, but any of ye fine lads care to help fix me ship?","story_atlab_sokka_02_13":"She be right moody today. Hit some weird iron balls and got herself beached...","story_atlab_sokka_02_14":"Sounds like a boatload of trouble!","story_atlab_sokka_02_15":"Hey, no problem, I'm Water Tribe! I’ll see what I can do. Sorry Wallace, I gotta go!","story_atlab_sokka_02_16":"I'll repair the rest of your gear in the meantime. Good luck!","story_atlab_sokka_03_name":"Great Navigator Sokka","story_atlab_sokka_03_01":"There, that should get you to port safely, at least.","story_atlab_sokka_03_02":"That's a proper fix. All solid-like!","story_atlab_sokka_03_03":"....Your rudder's held together with driftwood and pieces of my shirt.","story_atlab_sokka_03_04":"I wouldn't say \"solid-like\". More like, Sokka fix.","story_atlab_sokka_03_05":"Yo ho ho! How come a landlubber like ye be fixin' ships, then?","story_atlab_sokka_03_06":"Water Tribe life is all about boats and fishing. I was sailing before I could walk.","story_atlab_sokka_03_07":"Just recently, I even came up with plans for a waterbending-powered submarine!","story_atlab_sokka_03_08":"Yer speakin' all landlubby. What be that?","story_atlab_sokka_03_09":"It's... uh, a metal ship that goes underwater.","story_atlab_sokka_03_10":"Sounds to me like yer sending sea dogs to Davy Jones' Locker in a fancy box.","story_atlab_sokka_03_11":"Did I just hear, \"highly dangerous, untested prototype\"?","story_atlab_sokka_03_12":"Ah... not quite-","story_atlab_sokka_03_13":"I like your style. Come with me, new guy.","story_atlab_sokka_03_14":"Yo ho ho, back to sea! Anchors aweigh, before the bounty hunters get here!","story_atlab_sokka_03_15":"Arr, better dodge the floaty iron balls this time.","story_atlab_sokka_04_name":"Great Inventor Sokka","story_atlab_sokka_04_01":"Fascinating! Not gonna lie, your blueprint's a bit shoddy...","story_atlab_sokka_04_02":"...But with a bit of elbow grease, I think that submarine can work!","story_atlab_sokka_04_03":"Genius, right? I knew it!","story_atlab_sokka_04_04":"Though keep in mind it's designed to be operated by Waterbenders.","story_atlab_sokka_04_05":"Details, details. We'll figure something out.","story_atlab_sokka_04_06":"Just think! With this, we could explore the Sunken Temple!","story_atlab_sokka_04_07":"Oh, and it doesn't hold a lot of air, so keep the trips short.","story_atlab_sokka_04_08":"...Are you listening?","story_atlab_sokka_04_09":"Don't lean on that large iron ball.","story_atlab_sokka_04_10":"...Huh? Woah! Why not?","story_atlab_sokka_04_11":"My prototype sea bomb. Don't touch it. Very explody.","story_atlab_sokka_04_12":"...Oh.","story_atlab_sokka_04_13":"Well anyway, let me know how the prototype goes.","story_atlab_sokka_04_14":"If it works... we have a use for them in the future.","story_leather_00_01":"Hey dude. I woke up with a weird idea this morning.","story_leather_00_02":"I think it's time for me to become a Champion, dude.","story_leather_00_03":"That's what the leather told me, dude.","story_leather_alt_00_01":"Hey dude, I'm back to the Champion business.","story_leather_alt_00_02":"New year, new me, right?","story_leather_00_hire_01":"Alright, dude!

I think I'm done being a Champion.","story_leather_farewell_02":"It's a lot more responsibilities than I thought, dude. I barely have time for my leather!","story_leather_farewell_03":"Maybe I'll try again next year, dude. See you in town!","story_leather_01_name":"Leather and the Tree","story_leather_01_01":"Thanks for the help, dude.","story_leather_01_02":"No problem, Tamas! That's a lot of leather!","story_leather_01_03":"Got a big haul today. Mind your step, though.","story_leather_01_04":"Yeah... it's bumpy around here... Woah!","story_leather_01_05":"Woah! Ow!","story_leather_01_06":"Sorry, Tamas! Are you OK?","story_leather_01_07":"Bumped my head a bit, dude. I think I'm fine.","story_leather_01_08":"...I just got a flash of genius, dude.","story_leather_01_09":"Gotta go, dude. This is big.","story_leather_01_10":"Uh, sure! Glad to help!","story_leather_01_11":"...But what do I do with all this scattered leather...?","story_leather_02_name":"Foretold by Prophecy","story_leather_02_01":"...and that's how I hit my head, dude. Got a small bump here.","story_leather_02_02":"This one listens, but assist it can not.","story_leather_02_03":"The flows of ether divine and reveal, but they do not heal.","story_leather_02_04":"It's still magic, right? C'mon dude, just touch it with your magic hands.","story_leather_02_05":"There is no-","story_leather_02_06":"...!!!","story_leather_02_07":"This... destiny...! Overwhelming...!","story_leather_02_08":"You sure that worked, dude? I'm still feeling a bit dizzy.","story_leather_02_09":"...Apologies. A new vision arose that requires meditation.","story_leather_02_10":"Seek the Goddess' Favored for your... wounds. This one must depart at once.","story_leather_02_11":"Aight dude. Guess I'll just walk it off, feeling pretty strong lately.","story_leather_03_name":"The Champion Union","story_leather_03_01":"So there's a new, uh, Champion in town.","story_leather_03_02":"Yo ho ho! Me hopes he's a stud!","story_leather_03_03":"Hey dudes.","story_leather_03_04":"Blasted barnacles! Are ye kiddin' me?","story_leather_03_05":"Tamas!? When did you...","story_leather_03_06":"Decided to give this Champion business a shot, dude. Doesn't look too hard.","story_leather_03_07":"Um... Tamas, why don't you tell us what you do?","story_leather_03_08":"I give monsters a whack, dude. I can also sniff out leather items for miles.","story_leather_03_09":"Hoy! Stealin' stuff is ME shtick! Find yer own!","story_leather_03_10":"It's not stealing, dude. People just leave them all over the place.","story_leather_03_11":"Things are about to get pretty interesting around here!","story_leather_03_12":"Arr, ye may be right...","story_leather_04_name":"Unsung Hero","story_leather_04_01":"My King, I have a most unusual report.","story_leather_04_02":"I am all ears, as always! Go right on!","story_leather_04_03":"Heroes and caravans report that roads are safer than ever.","story_leather_04_04":"Monsters make themselves scarce, and even appear too afraid to attack anyone.","story_leather_04_05":"Splendid news!","story_leather_04_06":"However, we cannot think of any reason behind this strange behavior.","story_leather_04_07":"Equally strange is a sudden crash in the market for Leather goods...","story_leather_04_08":"A coincidence, I am sure! Let us feast and celebrate these good news!","story_leather_04_09":"Perhaps, my King... perhaps.","story_king_00_01":"Exalted shopkeeper, I have a most humble request to make.","story_king_00_02":"Take me to the dungeons, so that I may witness their majesty with my own eyes!","story_king_00_03":"My lands have gone unsurveyed for too long.

Your favorite Champion has returned!","story_king_alt_00_02":"Mere castle walls cannot hold a king whose heart yearns for adventure!","story_king_alt_00_03":"Let us be off! To the dungeons!","story_king_00_hire_01":"That takes care of the paperwork!","story_king_00_hire_02":"Let us be off! To the dungeons!","story_king_farewell_01":"King Reinhold...","story_king_farewell_02":"Ah... It would seem my duties have caught up to me!","story_king_farewell_03":"\"Piled up\", I would rather say. Dignitaries are waiting.","story_king_farewell_04":"Farewell, shopkeeper!

Petitioners, step forth!","story_king_01_02":"Hmph.","story_king_01_03":"What can Reinhold's kingdom do for its subjects, large... bear-man?","story_king_01_04":"I think you should ban all magic and kick out the spellcasters.","story_king_01_05":"Ah... that is... erm...","story_king_01_06":"We shall... take your proposition into consideration! Next!","story_king_01_07":"Hiii! I think we should make every day into PIÑATA DAY!","story_king_01_08":"What a splendid idea!

I am merely getting in touch with a fellow Imperial citizen.","story_king_02_04":"How is our foolish King doing these days?","story_king_02_05":"Your spying must be getting rusty, Dononvan. Reinhold is far from the fool you believe him to be.","story_king_02_06":"Though he smiles, he sacrifices much for his people.","story_king_02_07":"Something the Emperor... OUR Emperor, could learn from.","story_king_02_08":"My role so far has been to keep him from ruining himself in the name of his people.","story_king_02_09":"Is that so? Fascinating.","story_king_02_10":"He is a fool with a heart of gold, yes. But underestimate him at your own peril.","story_king_03_name":"Royal Afterhours","story_king_03_01":"Whew! This pile of reports isn't getting any smaller, is it?","story_king_03_02":"It appears we should brace for another all-nighter.","story_king_03_03":"Thank you for assisting me through this, dear Sia!","story_king_03_04":"It is nothing, my King. Now then, onto the next report...","story_king_03_05":"The farmers from Southburg have come short on their taxes, citing a poor harvest.","story_king_03_06":"I believe this is the second time, now...","story_king_03_07":"Send some of my court wizards to investigate. Perhaps some blight curses their lands.","story_king_03_08":"A most generous solution.","story_king_03_09":"And forgive their taxes again. It's what my father would've wanted!","story_king_03_10":"Very well. I do believe King Keinan would've done the same.","story_king_03_11":"The crown he's left behind is heavy indeed...","story_king_03_12":"What does the next report say?","story_king_03_13":"This report speaks of border tensions with the neighboring Empire...","story_king_04_name":"Jumping at Shadows","story_king_04_01":"...","story_king_04_02":"My King-","story_king_04_03":"Eek!","story_king_04_04":"P-please announce your presence if you are to sneak up behind me!","story_king_04_05":"Ah, that ninja's attack weighs heavily upon your mind, does it not?","story_king_04_06":"Of course! I lived but by a hair's breath!","story_king_04_07":"Shall I double the guard?","story_king_04_08":"That... will not be necessary. But please do not step so lightly in the future!","story_king_04_09":"As you wish, my King.","story_king_04_10":"Ah, it is good to be home... Huh?","story_king_04_11":"ARGH!!! N-ninjas!?","story_king_04_12":"Our apologies. It seems we were off the mark.","story_king_04_13":"Shadow Translocation can be somewhat inaccurate, at times.","story_king_04_14":"P-please refrain from performing SHADOW TELEPORTATION within my throne room!","story_king_04_15":"K-king Reinhold? Are you well?","story_king_04_16":"Yes! Please show this... ghastly visitor to the exit.","story_king_04_17":"Very well.

A taste for luxury, style and all things expensive...","dialog_jeweler_unhiredgreetings_02":"For a person of your caliber, only the most expensive rings will do.","dialog_jeweler_hirequestion":"You will find my price more than fair.","dialog_jeweler_investgold":"All pieces accounted for, thank you.","dialog_jeweler_investgold_02":"I do love the glitter of gold.","dialog_jeweler_investgems":"You had my interest, now you have my attention.","dialog_jeweler_investgems_02":"You know how to sweet talk a jeweler.","dialog_jeweler_investgems_03":"Azure diamonds, round cut, 25 carats... Where did you find such beauties, shopkeeper?","dialog_jeweler_underupgrade":"I'm... improving security around here. Traps and such. All perfectly legal.","dialog_jeweler_afterupgrade":"We're open again. Don't touch anything expensive, it's probably trapped.","dialog_jeweler_chat":"Don't bother accepting Theodore's invitation to play chess. He will destroy you, as he did everyone else here.","dialog_jeweler_chat_02":"Gemstones are particularly receptive to magical enchantments. Seems to me like magic has good taste.","dialog_jeweler_chat_03":"Not everyone can attune themselves to magical rings and amulets. It's rather taxing on the mind and body.","dialog_jeweler_chat_04":"That ninja girl... I'd better not catch her snooping around my inventory.","dialog_jeweler_chat_05":"I don't trust Durhan. All that unsupervised mining... I'm sure he keeps the best finds for himself.","dialog_jeweler_chat_06":"You have no idea what it's like living next to that... Engineer. Explosions, day and night!","dialog_jeweler_chat_07":"Wealthy customers won't bother visiting a tiny shack. Expand your shop to sell those expensive items.","dialog_jeweler_chat_08":"King Reinhold himself might visit your shop, sometime. You couldn't ask for a better customer.","dialog_jeweler_chat_09":"That fairy girl settled... in my backyard. Goddess help me.","dialog_jeweler_chat_10":"Moonstones, huh? I certainly wish I could get my hands on some of those.","dialog_jeweler_bounty_craft":"I'm expecting an important market shift soon. This bounty is mutually beneficial.","dialog_jeweler_bounty_slay":"I'm expecting a jewel shipment soon. Ensure the roads are safe.","dialog_jeweler_bounty_quest":"My business could use a little scarcity around these components.","dialog_jeweler_bounty_surcharge":"Supply and demand are two sides of a very valuable coin.","dialog_jeweler_bounty_discount":"Discount is not part of my vocabulary. Consider it professional curiosity.","visit_jeweler_quality_00_01":"Shopkeeper, you need to see this. When I got my hands on THAT piece...","visit_jeweler_quality_00_02":"I simply knew you'd be interested. Am I right?","visit_jeweler_quality_christmas_00_01":"Tch. \"Season of giving\"... what a farce.","visit_jeweler_quality_christmas_00_02":"Still, you've been a reliable business partner so far.","visit_jeweler_quality_christmas_00_03":"I suppose you could have this... for free. But keep it between us.","visit_jeweler_bulk_00_01":"Glittering gold, trinkets, baubles... I got a handful of them that aren't selling.","visit_jeweler_bulk_00_02":"You're not a bad merchant. Perhaps you can succeed where I have failed?","visit_jeweler_bulk_christmas_00_01":"Tch. \"Season of giving\"... what a farce.","visit_jeweler_bulk_christmas_00_02":"Still, you've been a reliable business partner so far.","visit_jeweler_bulk_christmas_00_03":"I suppose you could have this... for free. But keep it between us.","thanks_jeweler_00_01":"It's a deal then. I'll be counting the coins.","thanks_jeweler_christmas_00_01":"I'll be expecting a thank you gift with my name on it.","dialog_champions_greetings":"Argon, reporting for duty!","dialog_champions_greetings_02":"Shopkeeper! Do you bring daring tales of mercantilism?","dialog_champions_investgold":"Yes! Thank you, shopkeeper!","dialog_champions_investgems":"Wow! Thanks for believing in me!","dialog_champions_investgems_02":"I won't let you down!","dialog_champions_underupgrade":"100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats, 10km run! Heroes need to be in top shape!","dialog_champions_afterupgrade":"Whew, I think we learned some new tricks thanks to you, shopkeeper!","dialog_champions_afterupgrade_02":"We came up with some new training drills. The Training Hall is back in business!","dialog_champions_chat":"How's business? Have any glorious quests in need of Heroes?","dialog_champions_chat_02":"I volunteer to train aspiring Heroes here. There is much to learn by teaching!","dialog_champions_chat_03":"Fighters are the toughest Heroes around. They tend to draw enemy attacks away from others, too.","dialog_champions_chat_04":"Rogues don't look like much, but they're adept at dodging attacks and landing powerful critical hits.","dialog_champions_chat_05":"Spellcasters are frail, but no other Heroes can match their attack power.","dialog_champions_chat_06":"Heroes all have their own style, even within the same class. There's no guessing what skills they'll learn.","dialog_champions_chat_07":"Some Hero skills seem rarer than others... Those learned later in their career are better than usual, I bet.","dialog_champions_chat_08":"Try equipping your spellcasters with Spell items. It's the secret behind their offensive power!","dialog_champions_chat_09":"If a quest seems too difficult, try using boosters! Even Champions need a hand sometimes.","dialog_champions_chat_10":"The path to becoming a true hero is long and arduous, but I won't give up!","dialog_champions_chat_11":"A Living Roots crawled through the window the other day! It gave us quite a fright!","dialog_champions_chat_12":"Keep an eye out for Champion Coins! They might allow you to meet some new people!","dialog_champions_chat_13":"There's a rumor among the Heroes about a... Titan Soul. They say it can unlock the true potential within anyone!","dialog_champions_bounty_craft":"The Heroes could use a few of these!","dialog_champions_bounty_slay":"Some novice Heroes are ready for their first sortie. Can you guide them around?","dialog_champions_bounty_quest":"I'm ready for a quest! How about these components?","dialog_champions_bounty_surcharge":"You got this, shopkeeper! I believe in you!","dialog_champions_bounty_discount":"Heroes can use a little discount every now and then!","dialog_townhall_greetings":"Ah, young one. Stay awhile and listen.","dialog_townhall_greetings_02":"Eh? What was that? My hearing isn't getting any better...","dialog_townhall_greetings_03":"Such spring in your steps!","dialog_townhall_investgold":"Good... Very good!","dialog_townhall_investgold_02":"Ah, pension funds!","dialog_townhall_investgems":"Ah, the exuberance of youth...","dialog_townhall_underupgrade":"Ah, shopkeeper. The city is laying down foundations for new some shops!","dialog_townhall_afterupgrade":"We've expanded the shopping district. You can now invite new merchants to the city, if you'd like.","dialog_townhall_afterupgrade_02":"The Town Hall is buzzing with activity once again!","dialog_townhall_chat":"Heroes need to train some before they can use stronger equipment. Safety first!","dialog_townhall_chat_02":"To see you out and about, investing and making friends... You make this old man proud.","dialog_townhall_chat_03":"There's a mysterious ninja prowling around town... Is she a friend of yours?","dialog_townhall_chat_04":"How's your Guild doing? Make sure to invest in the city every now and then.","dialog_townhall_chat_05":"Your investments will follow you if you decide to join a new guild, so don't worry too much about it.","dialog_townhall_chat_06":"Have you been collecting those strange golden coins? Champions seem to like them.","dialog_townhall_chat_07":"Mighty Sorcerers won't deign to work with just anybody, but their attack power is legendary.","dialog_townhall_chat_08":"You've heard of Warlocks haven't you? They terrify even Sorcerers... But such power comes at a cost.","dialog_townhall_chat_09":"This city certainly seems more lively with our new Restaurant and Bakery!","dialog_townhall_bounty_craft":"Care to listen to an old man's request?","dialog_townhall_bounty_slay":"These monsters are giving honest townsfolk a hard time. Can you take care of it?","dialog_townhall_bounty_quest":"Oh my, how did this get here? I am no good with technology....","dialog_townhall_bounty_surcharge":"Such is the art of mercantilism...","dialog_townhall_bounty_discount":"Back in my days, a Squire Sword cost a mere 1 gold!","churn_00_01":"Ah, shopkeeper!","churn_00_02":"Since you've been working so hard lately, the townsfolk pitched together to buy you a gift.","churn_00_03":"Don't be shy now, open it!","dialog_tavern_greetings":"Your favorite seat's right over there, hun.","dialog_tavern_greetings_02":"So what's the word on the street?","dialog_tavern_greetings_03":"What can I get you, shopkeeper?","dialog_tavern_greetings_04":"The usual, shopkeeper?","dialog_tavern_greetings_05":"Your favorite stew's on the menu today!","dialog_tavern_greetings_06":"Ah, shopkeeper!

Is that true?","dialog_tavern_chat_02":"The Yetis of the Aurora Caves are kind of cute aren't they?","dialog_tavern_chat_03":"Gorza used to be a mighty warrior, you know? She wouldn't admit it, but I think she prefers her peaceful woodcutter life.","dialog_tavern_chat_04":"The Aurora Caves are a popular dating spot around these parts. They look absolutely stunning at night!","dialog_tavern_chat_05":"With proper funding, I can organize expeditions to chart the dungeons. It should make your quests more efficient!","dialog_tavern_chat_06":"Things can get pretty rowdy when Gorza drinks here. Thankfully her brother is much more down to earth.","dialog_tavern_chat_07":"You can send an incomplete party on a quest if you want. They'll take longer, though.","dialog_tavern_chat_08":"Have you met my sister Maya? She's in charge of the Fortune Zone.","dialog_tavern_chat_09":"Those Monks are a weird bunch, aren't they? No weapons, no armor, all punching!","dialog_tavern_chat_10":"You won't believe this but... I saw a Grandmaster the other day! I can't imagine what trials a Monk has to go through...","dialog_tavern_chat_11":"I dont know how Yolanda does it, but she manages to raise monsters while keeping up with her knitting.","dialog_tavern_bounty_craft":"I overheard an interesting bit of info at the tavern. You should capitalize on it!","dialog_tavern_bounty_slay":"There's a few uglies out there that are better gone than about, don't you agree?","dialog_tavern_bounty_quest":"I just got a tip about an especially bountiful area in this region...","dialog_tavern_bounty_surcharge":"A wink and a smile is all it takes.","dialog_tavern_bounty_discount":"It's all about returning customers!","visit_tavern_00_01":"Hi! Surprised to see me? Took a short break to pay you a visit.","visit_tavern_00_02":"But most importantly, I got a little something for you...","visit_tavern_01_01":"Hi, hun. Did you miss me?","visit_tavern_01_02":"Got you something special today. Tipsy patrons leave the weirdest tips, don't they?","visit_tavern_christmas_00_01":"I do love the holiday season! The snow, the decorations...","visit_tavern_christmas_00_02":"...And a tavern bustling with patrons eager to tip, of course!","visit_tavern_christmas_00_03":"I suppose you could have some. It is Christmas after all!","thanks_tavern_00_01":"Let's keep this between us!","thanks_tavern_01_01":"Best if we didn't let anyone hear about this transaction. It'll be our little secret!","thanks_tavern_christmas_00_01":"Happy Holidays, and happy New Year!","dialog_inn_greetings":"Business has been peaking lately with all those Heroes about.","dialog_inn_greetings_02":"Ah, shopkeeper!

Perhaps next time we can afford a Jacuzzi! Hah hah!","dialog_inn_afterupgrade_02":"New rooms, new beds. Welcome to the new Emerald Inn!","dialog_inn_chat":"Whichever Yeti finds the biggest icicle becomes their leader. An odd bunch to be sure!","dialog_inn_chat_02":"That mysterious floating island... No one has ever been there, as far as I can tell.","dialog_inn_chat_03":"There's been a shadowy figure staying at my inn lately. Didn't quite catch her name though.","dialog_inn_chat_04":"The key to attracting customers is having a big shop! And displaying tons of items on racks!","dialog_inn_chat_05":"Those Champions are in a league of their own. They don't even need equipment!","dialog_inn_chat_06":"I can hear Ismael singing while he works, right across the street. He's not half bad.","dialog_inn_chat_07":"I used to be a Barbarian back in the days, you know? I'd wager I still have my old axe stored somewhere...","dialog_inn_chat_08":"That fairy Maylee has an impressive coin collection.

Vanished overnight!","dialog_inn_chat_10":"Everyone's been in uproar about a Lost City of Gold lately. Have you ever heard of it?","dialog_inn_chat_11":"Tutu Mano's restaurant offers fierce competition! I hope you'll give our inn a chance!","dialog_inn_bounty_craft":"I loved these back during my adventuring days. How about crafting a few for old times' sake?","dialog_inn_bounty_slay":"I put a big bet that you could handle it. Don't back out on me!","dialog_inn_bounty_quest":"The Inn is a bit packed with Heroes at the moment. Can you do me a favor and organize a few expeditions?","dialog_inn_bounty_surcharge":"I have a few patrons with more coin than sense. How about I send them your way?","dialog_inn_bounty_discount":"You offer my patrons a discount, and I send them your way! How's that deal sound?","visit_inn_00_01":"Shopkeeper, old pal! I found some of my old adventuring supplies.","visit_inn_00_02":"It's no use to me now, though. How about a gift for your Heroes?","visit_inn_christmas_00_01":"Ah, finally some peace and quiet!","visit_inn_christmas_00_02":"It's pretty busy down at the Emerald Inn during the holidays, let me tell you!","visit_inn_christmas_00_03":"Figured I'd come over for a little breather and a chat, if you don't mind.","visit_inn_christmas_00_04":"Oh, and you can have this, too.","thanks_inn_00_01":"Pleasure doing business with you, as always.","thanks_inn_01_01":"Thanks.

Use it well.","dialog_mana_afterupgrade_02":"Ether now flows unimpeded towards the Merchant's abode.","dialog_mana_chat":"To see beyond the veil... is a boon and curse both.","dialog_mana_chat_02":"The Enchanter... Powerful magic surrounds him, yet not entirely his own.","dialog_mana_chat_03":"He Who Digs tempts fate with every strike of the pickaxe... The leylines below must not be tampered with.","dialog_mana_chat_04":"Fate has much in store for the Young Knight. His resolve will be tested.","dialog_mana_chat_05":"She Who Stalks... When one is driven by revenge, care must be taken to not lose oneself.","dialog_mana_chat_06":"...The Ether Well is not open to tourists.","dialog_mana_chat_07":"Turn to the sky and ask the stars for guidance... else shift your gaze inward and seek wisdom within.","dialog_mana_chat_08":"I am but a herald for fate's will... A beacon amidst the tumultuous torrent of what may.","dialog_mana_chat_09":"Let not the prophecies cloud your mind. Fate's hand will see you to your destination.","dialog_mana_chat_10":"An empire toying with the threads of time itself... Pride to ashes, hubris to ruins.","dialog_mana_chat_11":"The Lost City of Gold...

With fate at your side, proceed with caution still.","dialog_mana_bounty_quest":"Troves of natural wonders lie yonder, awaiting one with brave heart and deft hands.","dialog_mana_bounty_surcharge":"Untold potential rests within the mundane, aptly appraised by the trained eye.","dialog_mana_bounty_discount":"Fate shall see the open hand rewarded in due time.","visit_mana_christmas_00_01":"The spirit of giving looms ever nearer, warming the hearts of men and elves alike.","visit_mana_christmas_00_02":"I am thus compelled, if the Merchant allows.","visit_mana_00_01":"Fate has led me here, to a Merchant in need...","visit_mana_01_01":"The Ether stirs, seeking shelter among your bins.
